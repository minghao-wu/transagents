Chapter 70 East Arrival Cave Master (8) This was exactly what Song Fu and the others wanted to ask, but someone beat them to it. At that, they looked at each other. How could they answer it when they didn't even know what was going on?! Miao Yi immediately flew toward the source of the loud noise, and Yan Xiu and his companion followed suit. Song Fu and the others glanced at each other before going to see what was happening. As they arrived at the entrance of the mountain, under the moonlight, they saw the stone plaque with the characters 'East Arrival Cave' shattered on the ground. Everyone was shocked. Someone had actually destroyed the entrance of East Arrival Cave. Miao Yi turned around abruptly, his face twisted in a fierce expression as he looked at Song Fu and the others. He coldly sneered, "Very well! I just arrived today, and it looks like someone already can't wait to challenge my authority! Very well!" Song Fu and the others were stunned. They knew exactly what Miao Yi meant, but they definitely weren't responsible for this. Just moments ago, they were sitting together discussing how to challenge Miao Yi, and they had only come out upon hearing the unusual noise. Initially, the few of them suspected Miao Yi's group was behind it, but seeing Miao Yi's reaction, they thought it was unlikely for Miao Yi to damage his own cave to prove a point. Miao Yi was the cave master after all, and it was quite embarrassing to have the entrance damaged right after he took over. The situation must be clarified, or unwarranted blame would surface if not addressed properly. Song Fu cupped his fists and said, "Cave Master, I promise you, we have nothing to do with this." The others also cupped their fists and swore. It seemed to be their first time treating Miao Yi seriously as a Cave Master. "Crafty excuses!" Miao Yi stared at Song Fu and said sternly, "I assigned you to guard the entrance today, and you tell me you don't know someone had destroyed it? Have you not deliberately allowed this to happen?!" "I..." Song Fu was at a loss for words. He hadn't come in the first place, but he couldn't possibly reveal it was because he never respected Miao Yi as the cave master. So, he could only cup his fists and said honestly, "Here's the thing, Cave Master. The servants of East Arrival City didn't show up, so we sorted out our meal, and to sate our hunger, we left for a moment. Little did we expect this to happen." Wang Zifa and the others also cupped their fists and said, "Cave Master, we can prove that Senior Brother Song Fu was eating with us just now." Miao Yi pointed at the fallen plaque and snapped, "Are you trying to tell me that it fell on its own? Don't you dare say it was blown over by the wind!" Song Fu fell silent, unable to defend himself. Still, he raise his hand and swore, "Cave Master, I can swear on the ancestral masters of the School of Blue Jade that this is absolutely not our doing. If there is a single lie in my oath, then may I, Song Fu, will meet a wretched end!" Miao Yi's gaze flickered uncertainly over the crowd, his tone growing dark, "Has come to East Arrival Cave to cause trouble?" Everyone was shocked, realizing that it was indeed possible. They quickly looked around. "What are you all waiting for? Do you want to have your throats slit in your sleep? Hurry up and spread out to search!" Miao Yi shouted angrily. "Yes!" Yan Xiu and the other two immediately complied with cupped fists and swiftly spread out into the surrounding forest. "Hmm?" Miao Yi let out a deep hum, glaring daggers at Song Fu and the others. He seemed to be questioning why they hadn't gone to investigate and if they knew something. They all had to prove that they had nothing to do with the incident at this time, so Song Fu immediately turned to his group and ordered, "What are you all still doing here? Obey the Cave Master's orders and search!" At that, everyone cupped their hands toward Miao Yi and immediately dispersed. However, Miao Yi stopped Song Fu. "Song Fu, come with me!" Song Fu was stunned. He cupped his fists in acknowledgement and followed behind Miao Yi. Just after everyone left, a figure resembling a person in water emerged in the same spot. It was none other than the extraordinary Lao Bai. Lao Bai stared at the fallen stone door plaque and shook his head with a soft chuckle. "Live is like a game of chess. How can a passionate young man rely only on brute strength? I've always worried that your nature is too kind, making you vulnerable... A real man should have his methods. A mere hothead won't rise far. Now, I feel much more at ease." The next second, his figure rippled like water once again, disappearing without a trace. Inside the East Arrival Grand Hall candlelight cast flickering shadows. Song Fu stood behind Miao Yi in the hall. Charcoal, who was outside, had stood up. It sneezed, seemingly having sensed something. Miao Yi stared at his throne expressionlessly, his hands behind his back, and his back faced toward Song Fu, not saying a word. The atmosphere between the two was a little tense. Song Fu waited for a while and ultimately couldn't help speaking up, "What have you summoned me for, Cave Master?" Do you know your offense, Song Fu?" Miao Yi said grimly. Song Fu smirked mockingly in response. After glancing at the food on the low table nearby, he asked plainly, "We have absolutely nothing to do with this, so what offense have I made?" "That's not what I'm asking!" Miao Yi turned around abruptly, fixing his gaze on him, and enunciated icily, "I ordered you to guard the entrance. Why did you leave your post without permission? Could it be that you don't take the commands of your Cave Master seriously?" Oh, have you just realized it? Song Fu thought to himself. I never took them seriously in the first place. Of course, he wouldn't say it out loud. Instead, he answered, "I already told you the truth. I had no other choice but to leave temporarily to find sustenance. I hadn't wished for such an incident to occur either." Miao Yi asked, "Do you think the Manor Head and Mountain Chieftain will believe your explanation after I report this matter to them?" Song Fu chuckled. "People have two faces. If you insist on framing me, then please do as you wish. However, please remember, Cave Master, that I also have a voice to defend myself. I'm no mute." Miao Yi sneered, "Looks like you're truly unrepentant!" The next second, Yan Xiu, Dan Biaoyi, and Qiu Shaoqun swiftly appeared at the door and walked in together. They saluted Miao Yi, saying, "Cave Master, we haven't found anyone suspicious for now." Miao Yi said, "What do you mean you haven't found anyone suspicious?! The suspicious person is right in front of us!" Seemingly receiving a secret signal, Dan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun swiftly closed the doors of the hall. Startled, Song Fu quickly turned around only to see the fierce-looking Yan Xiu swinging a pair of broadaxes furiously. Song Fu quickly pulled out his sword, a cold light flashing as it left its sheath. It clashed and clanged rapidly as he parried Yan Xiu's blows. Dan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun almost instantly drew their spears and joined the fray, attacking Song Fu together. Yan Xiu and Song Fu's cultivation levels were about the same, and the two evenly matched. With the addition of Dan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun, Song Fu's situation instantly became precarious. "Shameless scoundrels! How dare you plot against—" Surrounded and unable to escape, Song Fu's angry roar was cut short as the relentless attacks from Yan Xiu's axes and the spears of Shan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun pierced through his magical defenses and ruthlessly stabbed into his chest. Song Fu widened his eyes and tried to look back at Miao Yi. His lips trembled, his eyes burning with indescribable rage. He finally realized this was a trap. They hadn't planned to frame him using the gate plague but to separate him from his fellow disciples, preventing him from joining forces with his fellow disciples to resist. The main goal was to take his life. Chapter 71 East Arrival Cave Master (9) If not now, then when would they kill him?! Yan Xiu blade, showing no mercy. With a swing of his axe, he sent Song Fu's head flying. Dan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun also drew their spears from Song Fu's body. The three of them, still somewhat shaken, stopped and immediately looked at Miao Yi. Miao Yi did not intervene. Instead, he cast a spell to shield the table of food and wine from being affected by the clashes of their magical energies. With his magical energy dispelled, he stretched out his fingers and drew a cup of wine to his hand. After downing the liquid, he said plainly, "Finish the show." The three cupped their fists and quickly dashed to the back of the hall, disappearing. Finally, Miao Yi walked to the entrance of the hall and opened the door. After stepping over the threshold, he stroked Charcoal's mane while looking at the moonlight outside. His gaze was cold, yet his mind conjured an image of himself from years ago, holding the hands of his first younger brother and carrying his second younger brother, who was crying in fear, on his back. He felt helpless against the group of adults who had come knocking on his door, and, in his grief and anger, he drove a knife into his thigh, causing blood to flow profusely. I'm sorry, my brothers. I shouldn't have led you into such danger. It's all my fault. You must take care of yourselves. My abilities now are limited. Please give me a bit more time..." Miao Yi mumured to himself. The emerald bead hanging around his neck glimmered faintly. Charcoal shook his head and let out a sneeze. The sounds of fighting and Song Fu's tragic roar before his death had drawn his fellow disciples back. Leading the charge were Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao, both powerful  White Lotus Third Grade experts. They were followed by Shang Youliao, Hou Sheng, Wang Xiuqin, and Nan Sisi. Yan Xiu, Shan Biaoyi, and Qiu Shaoqun arrived last, seemingly coming in response to hearing the commotion. The group intended to enter the great hall to see what had happened, but they were stopped by Miao Yi, who was outside the doors. Miao Yi, standing upright on the steps at the entrance, astride his dragon street with a spear in his hand, looked down upon everyone with a chilly gaze. The night sky outside the great hall hung low, and the stars and moon shimmered. Inside the hall, the bright candlelight cast flickering shadows, creating a visual distortion that made it difficult to clearly discern Miao Yi's expression. This added an air of mystery and dignity to his presence, while a palpable sense of killing intent emanated from him. The members of the School of Blue Jade exchanged glances, a mix of uncertainty and caution in their eyes. Ultimately, Wang Zifa cupped his hands and asked, "Cave Master, we seem to have heard sounds of fighting and Senior Brother Song Fu's cries for help just now. There is also Senior Brother Song Fu's cry for help. May I ask if Senior Brother Song Fu is in the great hall?" "Yes, he's inside. However, he's already lost his head!" Miao Yi didn't hide anything. He raised the hand that was hanging by his thigh, lifting up a certain person's hair to reveal a severed head before casually chucking it toward everyone. Startled, the group instinctively backed away. They watched as a head rolled and tumbled at their feet, coming to a stop. Everyone widened their eyes and looked. It was Song Fu's head! While everyone was flabbergasted, the trio at the back exchanged discreet glances. Suddenly, Wang Zifa pointed his finger at Miao Yi on the steps and questioned angrily, "Did you kill Senior Brother Song Fu?!" Miao Yi looked down from his elevated position, devoid of any emotional color. He spoke in an icy tone, "I ordered him to guard the mountain gate, yet he dared to abandon his duty, leading to the destruction of the gate of East Arrival Cave. I asked him if he knew his guilt. Not only did he not acknowledge it, he even dared to speak insolently to his Cave Master. Am I not allowed to kill him when an arrogant madman like him treats his Cave Master's orders as child's play?!" Immediately, Wang Zifa and the others drew their swords and pointed them at Miao Yi. Wang Zifa asked sternly, "How dare you kill a disciple of the School of Blue Jade?!" "Insolent fools!" Miao Yi shouted angrily and warned, "I don't care which sect you are from. Since you have joined my East Arrival Cave, you should have forgotten the sect's concept and abide by the rules. Do you School of Blue Jade disciples wish to challenge the million-strong army under Chancellor Chen Lu? You all think too highly of yourselves!" He pointed his spear downward. "Song Fu is not the first White Lotus Third Grade cultivator to die in my hands, nor will he be the last! Yan Xiu, Dan Biaoyi, Qiu Shaoqun!" Instantly, the trio brandished their weapons, responding in unison, "Yes!" "If anyone dares to defy authority..." Miao Yi stood above them, pointing his spear at Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao. "I'll handle these two. The other four are yours to deal with!" "Yes, sir!" Dan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun bellowed in anger along with Yan Siu, who wielded a pair of broadaxes, "Kill anyone who dares to defy!" This was their arrangement. In any case, Miao Yi had already decided on Song Fu's fate. No matter the circumstances, he had to be killed as a deterrent to others. As for the remaining two White Lotus Third Grade cultivators, although Miao Yi wasn't confident that he could kill them, he still had the support of his steed, Charcoal. Engaging them wouldn't be an issue. As for the other four White Lotus Second Grade cultivators, with Yan Xiu leading Dan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun, they were more than capable to deal with them. Once the battle truly began, Yan Xiu's trio would immediately help Miao Yi deal with Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao after defeating the four. The odds of victory were quite high. The disciples of the School of Blue Jade looked at Miao Yi on the steps, then turned to glance at the trio who were ready for action. They quickly found themselves in a compromising spot. Everyone, as spectators, had witnessed it back at the battle of Transient Light Cave. Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao might not be able to defeat Miao Yi even if they joined forces, and if the battle dragged on, even the four White Lotus Second Grade disciples facing the trio would very likely fail. They had no chance of winning this battle. Moreover, they were still unaware of the fact that Song Fu's death was the result of the trio joining forces. They were secretly shocked and apprehensive that Miao Yi could kill Song Fu so speedily. "I, Miao Yi, am here. Who dares step forth to challenge me?!" Miao Yi issued a challenging shout again. "The School of Blue Jade will hold you accountable for killing its disciple!" Despite what Wang Zifa said, he had already put the sword down, not daring to act recklessly. Others followed suit and slowly lowered their swords. Seeing that the situation was now under control, Miao Yi snorted icily, "I don't give a d*mn about the School of Blue Jade. I'm only concerned about the East Arrival Cave's matters. If your stay here is not to your liking, feel free to leave. I won't stop you. If you wish to stay and listen to my orders, I won't mistreat you either. "From today onward, any East Arrival Cave subordinate who obeys my orders will receive three granule-sized orbs each year for White Lotus Third Grade and two for White Lotus Second Grade. Those who don't follow my orders won't receive a single pearl. Get lost while you still can!" Everyone was shocked. Even the trio was taken aback. Miao Yi had never told them about this before. Quickly, everyone calculated in their minds. East Arrival Cave had about 120,000 followers under its jurisdiction. They could collect roughly 120 Orbs of Will each year, handing over 80% and retaining 20%, which would amount to 24 pearls. Now, with three White Lotus Third Grade cultivators, they would require nine pearls, and the six White Lotus Second Grade cultivators would take up 12 more. That was already 21 pearls out of the 24 pearls, implying that the esteemed Cave Master, who had worked so hard to attain his position, was willing to be left with only three pearls. Chapter 72 East Arrival Cave Master (10) The disciples of the School of Blue Jade had gone to such lengths to curry favor with Yang Qing all for the Orbs of Will, had they not?! Song Fu's matter was instantly thrown to the back of his mind. He had to first figure out if this Cave Master's words were true or not. After a moment of hesitation, Wang Zifa cupped his fists and asked, "Cave Master, you're not playing with us, are you? Do you realize you'll only have three Orbs of Will left for yourself? If we—" Before he could finish speaking, he swallowed the words he wanted to say. He even swallowed a mouthful of saliva. Everyone stared at Miao Yi with wide eyes. To be exact, they were looking at the thing in Miao Yi's hand. It was an ordinary pearl-sized Orb of Will. It was sparkling and translucent, emitting a hazy white glow, quite eye-catching under the night sky. When it was pinched between Miao Yi's two fingers, Twisting between Miao Yi's two fingers, it was quite entrancing, making everyone's eyes shine. Nobody there was blind; in fact, their eyesight far surpassed that of ordinary people. That was actually an Orb of Will that had accumulated the willpower of ten thousand people for a year! "Orbs of Will? Three or two is nothing." Miao Yi flipped his fingers, and the Orb of Will had already been kept in his storage ring. He looked down at the crowd below and said, 'If all of you are willing to genuinely follow my orders, I have ways of obtaining even more. By then, what you receive annually might be even more than what I've promised. "For those who serve me loyally and perform meritorious deeds, I, as the Cave Master, won't hesitate to reward you generously!" Excitement surged through them—one after another, their eyes shone brightly! If there had been doubt at the beginning, seeing the Cave Master effortlessly produce an Orb of Will the size of a precious gem quickly stirred their hearts. Such caliber Orbs weren't something that an ordinary small town could produce. Even Yang Qing, as generous as he might be, wouldn't simply lavish them upon the Cave Master. Who knew, the Cave Master might even have an alternative source for these Orbs of Will. Logically speaking, in a small cave like East Arrival Cave, regardless of one's cultivation grade, if one's relationship with the Cave Master was not good, one might just receive one Orb of Will each year, and one wouldn't dare complain either. Yan Xiu's case in Transient Light Cave was an example. Now, according to Miao Yi's statement, if the supply of Orbs of Will was doubled or tripled, it meant that a White Lotus Third Grade cultivator could achieve in a hundred years what would typically take three hundred years to accomplish in terms of cultivation. Similarly, a White Lotus Second Grade cultivator's one hundred years of practice could be equated to two hundred years. What did this signify? It meant a significantly reduced cultivation time, allowing them to elevate their cultivation and strength faster. Some even harbored malicious intentions, thinking that it might be better to make a desperate attempt to snatch the Orbs of Will from Miao Yi's hands. However, upon reflection, they realized it wouldn't be appropriate. They might not be Miao Yi's match if they fought him alone. But who would ultimately own the thing if they tried to take it collectively? Even if one could obtain it for oneself, this Orbs of Will would only be worth ten granule-sized orbs. According to Miao Yi's promise, one would be able to obtain it within three years or so. It must be understood that for a cultivator, a mere three years of cultivation wasn't a long time. What would they do three years later after this successful snatch? Wouldn't that sever their path to wealth? After suppressing his thoughts of greed, which didn't outweigh the potential losses, Wang Zifa swallowed his apprehensions and respectfully asked, "Can we count on your words, Cave Master?" Miao Yi lowered his eyes and asked, "You disciples of the School of Blue Jade are in cahoots with each other. Do you think it will do me any good if I don't keep my word?" Wang Zifa and Zhu Tianbiao exchanged a glance, then turned back to their fellow disciples, who were looking at them expectantly, and nodded. Swoosh! Everyone returned their swords to their sheaths and stood neatly in two rows, shouting in unison, "We, your humble subordinates, are willing to obey the Cave Master's orders!" Miao Yi straightened his posture and felt as though he was truly in control for the first time. This East Arrival Cave was now truly his territory! However, anyone could shout empty words, and Miao Yi wasn't that easy to dismiss. He said, "Words alone won't cut it. You need to show your commitment through action." After exchanging glances, Wang Zifa once again led by example. He cupped his fists and requested, "We beseech the Cave Master for guidance." Miao Yi said indifferently, "Song Fu offended his superior and ignored the orders of East Arrival Cave!" Everyone understood his intentions at once. He wanted everyone to express their opinions on this matter. The benefits were indeed not so easy to obtain. Wang Zifa sighed and said, "Actually, we also believe what Senior Brother Song did wasn't right. We have tried to persuade him many times in private, but Senior Brother Song refused to listen. We had no choice; after all, he's our senior. "A country has its laws, and a mountain has its rules. Your punishment is just and reasonable, Cave Master. We have no objections." Others followed suit, cupping their fists and responding, "The Cave Master's punishment is just and reasonable. We have no objections." Yan Xiu and his companions twitched their expressions, exchanging glances with each other. They were a bit annoyed, remembering how these beasts had bullied them earlier.  Now, they were suddenly so docile, eagerly pushing all the blame onto Song Fu. The three of them gazed at Miao Yi with a newfound sense of awe. From the Cave Master's actions, they could see his ability to change the situation in East Arrival Cave as easily as flipping his hand.  No wonder Manor Head Yang Qing would stand against the public and let him take charge of East Arrival Cave! "While Song Fu's actions are detestable, and he deserves to die, he's still a disciple of your School of Blue Jade. Currently, South Edict Manor and the School of Blue Jade are working together. It is not worth ruining the friendship between the two over him alone. This matter can't be avoided; it needs to be reported to provide an explanation." At that, Miao Yi paused, his gaze sweeping over the crowd before he continued, "My word alone might not alleviate the doubts of the School of Blue Jade. If you, as fellow disciples, are willing to testify, it will naturally dispel their suspicions. "I wonder if you all are willing to write testimonies and report to the Mountain Chieftain alongside me? The trio couldn't help sniggering, thinking the cave master had a rather ruthless approach. Wang Zifa and the others looked strained. They finally understood what it meant to do bad things and wanted a good reputation. This fellow killed someone from the School of Blue Jade yet didn't want to take responsibility. He even wanted the disciples of the School of Blue Jade to assert that the disciple deserved to die. Didn't he disregard the School of Blue Jade? Wasn't he underestimating them? Seeing that these people were silent, Miao Yi sighed and said, "If you are unwilling to write, I won't force you. However, consider this: once the School of Blue Jade investigates this matter and learns that you obtain two or three Orbs of Will every year, no one will likely hold me accountable. After all, the Orbs of Will have higher regard than me. If someone else were the Cave Master, they would not be as generous as I am. Instead, they might even try to relocate you before serving me personally. By then, I won't be able to stop them. What do you think?" His words hit their raw nerves. What Miao Yi said was not a possibility but a certainty. Someone would certainly transfer them away. The School of Blue Jade disciples assigned to the lowest echelon didn't have much backing, to begin with. They wouldn't be able to withstand the scheming of their fellow disciples with more influence. Nan Sisi, who had some allure, could not help but mutter softly, "Senior Brother Wang, Senior Brother Song's defiance of the Cave Master's orders, which led to the destruction of the mountain gate, is indeed inexcusable." "That's right..." Several people immediately responded in hushed tones, careful not to make it too obvious. Nevertheless, they believed Senior Brother Wang would understand. Of course, Wang Zifa knew what everyone was thinking. Nobody wanted someone else to seize their benefits. However, if he truly went through with this, they would be deceiving their sect. Once they sided with Miao Yi, there was no turning back. They couldn't complain even if they were treated as slaves. Chapter 73 East Arrival Cave Master (11) However, the temptation of the Orbs of Will was still greater. Why else had they willingly come here to bow their heads to others? Wasn't it all for the Orbs of Will? As they whispered among themselves, Wang Zifa gritted his teeth and took it as an out. He sighed and said, "I am responding to the opinions of my fellow senior brothers and sisters. This isn't solely my decision." "Naturally!" "Naturally!" Everyone nodded in agreement and understood their senior brother's predicament. This matter couldn't be solely borne by one person; they needed to share the responsibility. Otherwise, someone might bring it up in the future, causing trouble. Only if everyone took responsibility would it be safe. With a unified consensus, they cupped their hands together and said, "We're willing to heed the Cave Master's orders!" Yan Xiu and his two companions, who had personally witnessed the astounding turn of events, looked at the Cave Master with incomparable admiration. He managed to pull so many disciples of the School of Blue Jade onto his treacherous ship in an instant. It was impossible not to be impressed. However, when they thought about it, they realized their own situation wasn't much better. They had personally killed Song Fu. If the matter came to light, they would not have an easy time either. It turned out that they, too, had boarded the Cave Master's treacherous ship; none of them could get off now. "Good!" The silver spear in Miao Yi's hand flashed, and he stored it in his ring. He dismounted from his steed and stood on the steps with his hands behind his back and a smile on his face.  a smile and said, "We still have time. You may as well write down your accounts now. After I've looked them over and found no issues, I'll have them sent to Mount Calming Sea to report to Mountain Chieftain." Everyone was speechless. They realized the Cave Master didn't even offer them a chance to change their minds; he wasn't even willing to let them reconsider overnight. But given the circumstances, what else could they do? They could only nod their heads in agreement. Miao Yi immediately raised his hand and said, "Yan Xiu, distribute the writing brushes to everyone." Yan Xiu complied promptly, rushing into the main hall and fetching a stack of writing brushes, handing them to everyone. Thus, a group of people stood below the steps of the hall, each meticulously jotting down their statements. As some began to write, they found themselves hesitating. They felt awkward about this act and questioned its appropriateness in relation to their deceased senior brother. After someone had finished, they ascended the steps to present their written statements to Miao Yi for inspection. After reviewing it, Miao Yi nodded slightly and said, "Very good!" However, he frowned after reading another's. "The way you've written this seems to suggest that Song Fu's crime isn't deserving of death. Isn't that downplaying it a bit?" The person who had presented the statement offered a sheepish smile and said, "I will rewrite it. I will rewrite it." Then, another person presented their statement. Miao Yi shook his head after reading it and said, "This is too exaggerated. It's best to be truthful. Make it serious, but not to the point where even I feel like killing him again… "The thing is, it will make the School of Blue Jade look bad. Tone it down a little." Yan Xiu and his two companions weren't left behind either; they each wrote a statement. Once everyone had finished writing and handed their statements to Miao Yi, he also wrote a report. In it, he stated that Song Fu had disobeyed orders, abandoned his post, leading to the destruction of the mountain gate, and even dared to defy the Cave Master. He then claimed that he, as the master, had acted within his rights to execute him as a punishment to set an example for others. He deliberately kept his statement more understated than the others because he believed it was essential to highlight the magnanimity of the Cave Master. With so many people criticizing Song Fu, one more critique from the Cave Master himself wasn't necessary. After affixing his seal, along with the City Lord's report that Yan Xiu had transcribed, he shouted, "Dan Biaoyi!" Dan Biaoyi immediately stepped forward and cupped his fists in respect. "I'm here!" "Set off immediately and send these documents to Mount Calming Sea. Report them to Mountain Chieftain. Make sure there are no mistakes!" Miao Yi handed him the documents. "Yes!" Dan Biaoyi acknowledged and quickly departed. Who knew how Qin Weiwwei, who had been concerned about Miao Yi's competence, would react upon seeing these documents? As they watched Dan Biaoyi disappear, they couldn't help but think that he didn't even allow them a single night's reprieve. After dealing with official matters, Miao Yi breathed a sigh of relief. He turned to Yan Xiu and said, "Inform the City Lord of East Arrival City to come and see me tomorrow morning. Have all the necessary personnel brought along, but ensure that it doesn't disrupt everyone's normal lives or hinder their cultivation." Everyone was happy about this matter. The group of people immediately cupped their hands and said, "You are wise, Cave Master!" "Don't be too pleased just yet." Miao Yi glanced at the School of Blue Jade disciples. "Don't think I'm unaware of the tricks all of you and Song Fu were playing. Song Fu's neglect of his duty led to the destruction of the mountain gate, and none of you can shirk your responsibility either. "I don't want to see my East Arrival Cave's reputation crumble tomorrow after these visitors leave. You all will stay up all night and rebuild the plaque for me. Don't just go through the motions; the reconstruction should be done well and look grand!" No one dared to object now. They could only accept the order. They didn't have to worry about assigning guards to be stationed at the mountain gate tonight, for there were many. Miao Yi waved his hand to dismiss everyone. Then, he turned to Qiu Shaoqun and said, "Clean up the hall." Yan Xiu led Miao Yi to the back hall, where the private cultivation and sleeping area for the Cave Master was located. Even Charcoal disregarded the rules and tagged along behind. On the way, Yan Xiu, who was leading the way, couldn't help but ask in a low voice, "Cave Master, isn't it a bit excessive to release so many Orbs of Will each year?" He treated himself as an inner confidant, adopting a concerned expression for the Cave Master. Miao Yi quirked a brow and said, "Why do you think I had Dan Biaoyi send those documents out overnight? It's to solidify the matter first. What can they do if I don't give it to them? They can go ahead and turn against me if they're not afraid of the School of Blue Jade holding them accountable!" Yan Xiu was rendered flabbergasted. "Don't overthink it. I'm just making a point. As long as we collect enough Orbs of Will every year, I will keep my word." Miao Yi patted Charcoal beside him and sighed, "After going on a business trip, I finally understand a person wouldn't get rich using only honest means. We can't just stay here honestly and take fixed wages. We still have to find another way to increase our income." What he said wasn't a lie but a true sentiment. Apart from the Orbs of Will the lady boss gifted him, he also got some after killing Mo Shengtu and Zhang Shucheng. Then, he even snatched one from Head Guard Huang. He began itching for more, and he had long been hoping to come to East Arrival Cave and make a big score. His powers alone was still too weak. Charcoal was upset. He had been restricted to the courtyard between the front and back halls. The front was Miao Yi's sleeping and cultivation area, which wasn't convenient for its large size. It could only lay down at the entrance, fully embodying its laziness. However, the courtyard here was quiet. There were ancient trees, potted plants, small pavilions, flower beds, and ponds. The environment was elegant, much better than lying outside. With his hands behind his back, Miao Yi walked into his personal space and couldn't help but click his tongue. He discovered that the treatment of the Cave Master was indeed extraordinary. A thick carpet lay underfoot, and exquisite furnishings adorned the surroundings. Luxurious and refined elements blended seamlessly. It was something he had never seen before. His horizons had been broadened that day. However, Yan Xiu's mind was elsewhere, pondering Miao Yi's words about finding another way and increasing income. He also wanted to know where the Cave Master had obtained the Orbs of Will that had gathered the strength of ten thousand people for a year. He tried asking, "Cave Master, how can we actually find another way to increase our income?" Miao Yi smiled and said, "The best way would naturally be to do what the Manor Head did and take over the entire South Edict Manor." Yan Xiu was shocked. He waved his hands and said, "No, our strength is not enough to annex the surrounding territories." Chapter 74 East Arrival Cave Master (12) "Of course, I know that. But if we seize someone else's territory now, I'm afraid we might not only not gain anything but even provoke others to seize our territory." Miao Yi shook his head with a hint of self-mockery and turned to sit on the luxurious fur-covered couch. He asked, "What do you say to us taking a trip to the Sea of Constellations?" "The Sea of Constellations?" Yan Xiu's eyes widened abruptly. He was the one who had told Miao Yi about that place. "Why go to the Sea of Constellations? That's the territory of Demon Saint Ji Huan! And the Sea of Constellations is infested with all kinds of demons; almost no human cultivator who ventures in comes back alive." "Didn't you say that any low-grade Demonic Core can exchange one thousand-man Orb of Will?" Miao Yi asked. Indeed, Yan Xiu had told him after witnessing Yang Qing's battle against Lu Yu. Demonic Cores and Yin Pills could be refined into transcendent artifacts, and they were also the source of power for transcendent artifacts. However, transcendent artifacts were still just transcendent artifacts; they couldn't cultivate. Thus, with every use, the energy contained within them would deplete. The more powerful the use, the more energy would be consumed. Naturally, the energy would need to be replenished. As a result, low-grade demon cores and the like became the best source of replenishment for transcendent artifacts. With a market, they were naturally valuable, whether exchanged for money or Orbs of Will. Alarmed, Yan Xiu asked, "Cave Master, your idea of finding another way, could it possibly involve going to the Sea of Constellations for hunting?" "Haha, I was just saying it casually. Look at how nervous you are. I was just joking." Miao Yi laughed it off. After sending Yan Xiu away, he entered his secluded cultivation chamber with his hands behind his back and checked it out. It was an underground space, rather sizable, and paved and walled with polished thick stone slabs. Copper braziers and oil lamps provided moderate lighting. In front of a stone platform for meditation sat a tranquil seat, with three large pools made of jade. Carved animal heads spewed water, one pool sourced from mountain springs, another from thermal springs, and the two merged into a third pool, producing water of suitable temperature. It was a good place to bathe. Miao Yi stripped off his clothes and soaked in the water, letting out a satisfied groan... Early the next day, Miao Yi, accompanied by a group of subordinates from East Arrival Cave, arrived at the mountain gate to inspect the newly built plaque. Miao Yi was overjoyed when he saw it. He had vaguely heard the sound of chisels and axes clanging throughout the night as the six cultivators had worked tirelessly to build the plaque. And indeed, the outcome wasn't ordinary. The main gate had four pillars and three entrances. The entrance to the main gate was more than three meters tall, and there were carvings of lifelike birds and animals. The auspicious clouds were tangled together, and there were three eye-catching words written on it, 'East Arrival Cave'. Below it, there was a coiling dragon and crouching tiger sculpture guarding the left and right. The entire mountain gate plaque was grand and striking.  It was tall and eye-catching. Miao Yi nodded in approval and said, "Not bad, not bad. It's even more magnificent than the mountain gate plaque of South Edict Manor. Looks like my East Arrival Cave men can be great stonemasons if they decide not to cultivate." Seeing him pleased, the worried School of Blue Jade disciples heaved a sigh of relief. Thad racked their brains last night for this plaque for fear of his possible nitpicking. After hearing the Cave Master's words, the group burst into hearty laughter, and the atmosphere between them instantly became more harmonious. However, unexpectedly, Miao Yi pointed at their blue attire and said, "Your clothes look so eye-catching people might think this is the School of Blue Jade and not the East Arrival Cave. "I don't care if you wear this when you return to the School of Blue Jade, but in East Arrival Cave, you should still unify the color of your clothes. "Yan Xiu, go to the city later on and find a tailor to change everyone's clothes to black." "Yes!" Yan Xiu cupped his hands and accepted the order. Meanwhile, the School of Blue Jade disciples looked at each other in dismay. Regardless of whether they liked it or not, Miao Yi continued to admire the plaque with his hands behind his back. Just as everyone gathered around the plaque, admiring it, Yan Xiu suddenly pointed to the mountain path beside the lake and said, "Cave Master, it seems the City Lord of East Arrival City has arrived." Everyone turned to look and saw a procession meandering along the mountain path by the lake. There were many sedan bearers, along with carriages and horses. It seemed they had brought a lot of things. Miao Yi only cast a casual glance and then focused his gaze on the great lake at the foot of the mountain for a moment before saying, "Yan Xiu, get someone to put more fish and shrimp in the lake later." Yan Xiu acknowledged. He knew it was probably prepared for Charcoal. Unlike other dragon steeds, he preferred fresh fish and shrimp and also liked playing in the water. With such a large lake here, it became Charcoal's paradise. "wang Zifa, arrange for someone to guard the gate. From now on, you will be in charge of arranging the personnel at the mountain gate. If someone were to damage it again, I will question you! The rest of you, go back to the main hall." Miao Yi turned and left. The City Lord of East Arrival City wasn't worth everyone standing here to greet. Wang Zifa wasn't so shortsighted. He naturally wouldn't assign the Cave Master's trusted aides, Yan Xiu and the others, to guard the mountain gate. He left his fellow disciple Shang Youlai on duty. Not long after the others returned to East Arrival Grand Hall, the fat East Arrival City Lord, Xu Xinliang, dismounted his steed at the mountain gate and politely requested Shang Youlai to announce his arrival. There was no need for an announcement. The cave master already knew they had arrived, so Shang Youlai let them in. No one dared to ride their horses in; all the steeds were left outside. Only the carriages and a large number of supplies pulled by horses and carts followed Xu Xinliang and were parked in the square outside the great hall. Sixteen sedan chairs were gently placed on the ground by the bearers. No one dared to be careless; inside were the attendants for the Immortals. A single attendant with two maids was the customary practice in the cultivation world. The rules weren't generous when it came to allocation. If every cultivator wanted more, with their ability to come and go without a trace, it would be the mortal women who would suffer. This would affect the devotees, and when the devotees were affected, there would be a loss of wishful power. Naturally, there needed to be restrictions. The others were not allowed to enter the main hall without permission. Only Xu Xinliang, who was dressed in official robes, wiped his sweat away, climbed the steps, and cautiously placed a heavy box on the platform. It was not that he was afraid that the Immortal would do anything to him, but every time there was a change of Cave Master in East Arrival Cave, that was the time when his position as City Lord was the most precarious. Once the Cave Master took a dislike to you, there was a possibility of being replaced. Inside the main hall, Yan Xiu and the others stood to the left and right as Xu Xinliang entered with a box. He dared not look up, walking to a designated spot before immediately setting down the heavy box, and knelt down, bowing with his head lowered. "East Arrival City Lord Xu Xinliang pays his respects to the cave master!" Sitting high above, Miao Yi smiled and said, "City Master Xu, we meet again." City Lord Xu was stunned. He looked up to find a familiar face and soon realized that he was the Immortal who had saved Madam Ji. He never thought Miao Yi was the new Cave Master of East Arrival Cave; the new Cave Master looked so young! "Rise and speak!" Miao Yi raised his hand, slightly supporting him. City Lord Xu immediately got up and took out a small box from his sleeve. He held it together with the large box and presented it to him. "Cave Master, this is a token of goodwill from the people of East Arrival City. I hope you can accept it." After the incident with Head Guard Huang, Miao Yi didn't need to look to know what was inside. He nodded slightly at Yan Xiu, who immediately went forward to receive it. Chapter 75 Qian'er, Xue'er Miao Yi didn't make things difficult for their City Lord. After a brief exchange, he found that the City Lord was rather familiar with the livelihood of East Arrival City, so he dismissed the latter after giving him some encouragement. After all, the two didn't have much in common to continue chatting either. City Lord Xu, relieved, left with his men, and Miao Yi had Yan Xiu open the gift for him. Sure enough, inside the small box contained a granule-sized pearl emitting a soft halo. Without hesitation, Miao Yi accepted it into his storage pouch. Inside the large box were five thousand gold crystals, not a small sum. It was all the wealth of the East Arrival City nation. Miao Yi was somewhat reluctant to accept such things deep down, having born a commoner. However, he had no choice but to accept it. He was not the only one in East Arrival Cave; so many people under him relied on the offers of the East Arrival City's followers. Regardless, he didn't keep a single gold crystal but had Yan Xiu distribute a portion of them. Each of the White Lotus Third Grade members received two hundred gold crystals, while the second grade members received half that, one hundred. The remaining amount was kept for the expenses of the cave, entrusted to Yan Xiu's safekeeping. Yan Xiu was rather happy, for he had never enjoyed such favored managing treatment as an inner confidant when he was in Transient Light Cave. Soon after, everyone left the great hall and came to the square where 16 beautiful young girls stood in a row, trembling in fear, awaiting the Immortal's selection. The two at the forefront were even more outstanding in appearance, graceful and delicate. Their heads hung low, resembling two shy blossoms about to bloom. Their fresh and pleasing appearances were a breath of fresh air. The only flaw was that they were still too young. Their bodies had not yet fully grown. The places that should be firm weren't, and the places that should be raised weren't either. They couldn't be considered sexy yet, but they had their unique charm. Perhaps there were people who favored this type. Everyone, led by Miao Yi, looked on. Miao Yi himself was a bit intrigued, curious as to the type of handmaidens Yan Xiu would personally choose for him. Yan Xiu, standing beside Miao Yi, beckoned the two young girls at the forefront. "You two, come forward. This is the Cave Master you will be serving!" The two girls glanced at Yan Xiu, then quickly looked at Miao Yi. They lowered their heads and cautiously walked over, both curtsying, their voices melodious. "Zhao Qian'er, Liu Xue, greets the Cave Master!" The other handmaidens couldn't help stealing glances, with a hint of envy. Although they were all servants of the Immortals, anyone with a bit of sense could tell that being the servant of this cave's master was naturally different from serving others. "Both of you, lift your heads." Yan Xiu ordered the two to raise their heads for Miao Yi to admire while explaining to Miao Yi on the side, "Both of them are fifteen years old. The slightly older one is named Zhao Qian'er and is skilled in dancing. The Other is Liu Xue, skilled in musicalShe is slightly older, her name is Zhao Qian'er. She is good at dancing. "The other Liu Xue, skilled in musical instruments. "Both of them have cultivation potential. What do you think, Cave Master?" Playing musical instruments and dancing? Miao Yi couldn't help but glance at Yan Xiu. He was no longer the ignorant young boy from the past. Finding a young and beautiful maid with talent and cultivation potential was no easy task. Yan Xiu had clearly put in a lot of effort. Seeing Miao Yi's lack of response, Yan Xiu probed, "If you're not satisfied, we can find others, Cave Master." Miao Yi pondered for a moment. despite his normal appreciation for beautiful women, he had long made up his mind. Regardless of the circumstances, as long as he hadn't found his two younger brothers, he wouldn't indulge in such matters. What if his two brothers were currently suffering while he, the eldest was enjoying... Nevertheless, he nodded and said, "No need to change. Keep them!" Having two handmaidens by his side could reduce distractions and benefit his cultivation. After the Cave Master had made his choice, it was the others' turn to choose. Even Shang Youlai, who was guarding the mountain gate, had been called over to make his selection. Only two remained at the end, and Yan Xiu said to Qiu Shaoqun, "Help Dan Biaoyi take these two back." Qiu Shaoqun nodded. However, it was only then that everyone realized there were two handmaidens less. Miao Yi also found it strange. Yan Xiu personally saw to the matter with East Arrival City. How could he have missed himself? He could not help but ask, "Where are your handmaidens?" Others might not have noticed it, but Miao Yi instantly felt it. In an instant, an unusual melancholy flashed across Yan Xiu's eyes. Yan Xiu forced a smile and bowed slightly. "I've gotten on in years and am used to being alone." "No, you're not old at all," Wang Zifa and the others immediately joked with him. "You're still in your prime." Nan Sisi and Wang Xiuqin also pursed their lips and smiled. Having gained benefits today, everyone was in a good mood. Yan Xiu laughed wryly, cupped his hands toward the crowd, and begged for mercy. The woman who couldn't bear the humiliation raised her blade and jumped on her horse, striving to achieve first merit to erase her disgrace, only to have her head chopped off in the end... That scene suddenly flashed through Miao Yi's mind. He silently stared at Yan Xiu for a while, then slowly turned his head, not saying anything else. But he understood why Yan Xiu did what he did. To be honest, because of Luo Zhen's death, he had harbored some resentment towards Yan Xiu. However, today he seemed to understand. Certain things were probably hard to erase from the heart of this old man accustomed to flattery. Qiu Shaoqun, who was also a surrendered soldier of Transient Light Cave, also glanced at Yan Xiu thoughtfully, not saying a word. After everyone had taken their respective handmaidens back, Yan Xiu beckoned Miao Yi's two handmaidens to follow the cave master. Charcoal, who had eaten and drank his fill, lay at the entrance of the rear hall, napping. Its bare snake tail whipped the ground occasionally, living quite leisurely. It had always had this bad habit. Hearing the commotion, it merely opened its eyes to take a look. Seeing that it was Miao Yi returning, it snorted and closed its eyes again. The few of them stood in the courtyard. Zhao Qian'er and Liu Xue cautiously surveyed the surroundings, a mix of curiosity and nervousness in their eyes. Miao Yi turned around and said, "Yan Xiu, they're new here and unfamiliar with the situation. Help them settle in and figure out what they should do. I'm taking Zhu Tianbiao with me to inspect the territory." That was something every new Cave Master had to do. They couldn't rule a territory without understanding it first. Getting familiar with their territory was an essential step. Charcoal's eyes widened when it heard Miao Yi was heading out. His ears perked up, and he raised his head slightly, looking in their direction. Yan Xiu hurriedly stopped Miao Yi, who was about to leave, and pointed at the two young girls, reminding him, "Cave Master, you haven't given them their names yet." "Don't they already have names?" Miao Yi was stunned. Yan Xiu smiled and said, "Those were their former names. Now that they are yours, you should bestow them new names, according to tradition, symbolizing a departure from the ordinary and fresh start. That's how it's usually done." "I see!" Miao Yi scratched his head. Although he had learned a bit of culture from Old Bai, his knowledge was limited. Naiming wasn't his strong suit. Finally, he laughed wryly and said, "Zhao Qian'er, Liu Xue, from now on, you two will be called Qian'er and Xue'er!" The names he bestowed upon the new handmaidens were so simple that even Yan Xiu was startled, but he couldn't say anything. He turned around and reminded the two handmaidens, "Aren't you going to thank the Cave Master for giving you names?" The two young ladies hurriedly bowed, "Qian'er, Xue'er, thank the Cave Master for granting us names!" Chapter 76 Qin Weiwei Was Bewildered (1) Miao Yi waved his hand, not saying much. He wasn't too concerned about the two handmaidens either and handed the responsibility over to Yan Xiu to take care of. He then turned and strode away. Outside the great hall, Zhu Tianbiao, who had been informed beforehand, had already changed his clothes and was waiting. As soon as Miao Yi came out, Charcoal rushed out from behind, its mouth latching onto Miao Yi's clothes, pulling, and not letting go. Zhu Tianbiao frowned deeply in response, not happy about the fact that the beast was behaving rather wildly. This was the main hall where official matters were to be discussed, yet the creature ran around like it was a stable. Its unruly behavior was the result of its master's condoning. He believed a few lashes would tame it. Of course, Miao Yi didn't want to resort to whipping.  Not only had Charcoal saved his life, but it was also advantageous to have a swift beast. It was also good for chores and catching fish. Only those who had experienced it would know its benefits. He turned around and patted Charcoal's head. "I have official business outside, but it's not somewhere I can take you along. Go play in the lake yourself. There are fish and shrimp inside." He pointed to the lake. Charcoal released its grip, shook his head, sneezed, then agilely landed in the square, and dashed away on all fours. Despite hating Charcoal for its lack of discipline, Zhu Tianbiao remained respectful on the surface. "To think your steed is so intelligent, Cave Master. It can understand everything you say, unlike our steeds. You train it so well, Cave Master." The guy was like a closed book. Even complimenting sounded strange coming from him. Miao Yi chuckled, knowing it was all flattery. He knew many people didn't like Charcoal's behavior. Qin Weiwei, for instance, wanted to kill it. Regardless, occasionally enjoying flattery wasn't so bad, even though this one was mediocre. Outside the mountain gate, there were two horses left behind by the City Lord of East Arrival City. Riding a dragon steed into the city for inspection would attract too much attention, and Miao Yi wouldn't be able to see what he wanted. He also wanted to assess Xu Xinliang's capabilities. If he wasn't up to the task and failed to ensure the timely submission of the Orbs of Will, Miao Yi's tenure as the Cave Master might not last long. If necessary, he would have to change the city lord. Bringing gifts alone wouldn't be enough. Miao Yi and Zhu Tianbiao left the mountain gate with their whips raised... At Mount Calming Sea, Qin Weiweisat cross-legged in a quiet chamber. She gradually retracted her power and pressed her palms against her abdomen. The lotus flower between her brows was also vivid and lifelike. As she opened her eyes, the attending Hong Mian and Lu Liu both respectfully bowed, expressing their delight, "Congratulations, Mountain Chieftain, on advancing your cultivation." Qin Weiwei withdrew her power, expelled the Orb of Will from her mouth, and tucked it away. She stretched her legs and got off the stone bed, smiling and shaking her head, "I just broke through to the White Lotus Sixth Grade." While her words seemed casual, the undisguised happiness on her face betrayed her true emotions. The two handmaidens smiled and remained silent, simultaneously helping her remove her clothes. With her garments cast aside, soon, an alluring figure with an elegantly curving waist and a prominent posterior was exposed in the tranquil chamber. The fair skin and delicate curves were enchanting, likely to quicken the heartbeat of anyone, even a woman. A pair of flawlessly fair bare feet slowly stepped into the warm water. Her delicate body squatted into the water and settled down. The water level just reached the plump peaks of her chest, a sight incredibly enticing. Hong Mian and Lu Liu unfastened her hair, and together, they began to gently wash her. As Hong Mian wiped Qin Weiwei's plump chest with a white towel, she chuckled, "Mountain Chieftain, you have such a great figure. What a shame that you're unwilling to find an official with dual cultivation when you have such a great figure." "You can say that again." Lu Liu, who was scrubbing her back, giggled and echoed, "What a waste of natural beauty!" Qin Weiwei blushed, glared at them, and scolded, "You shameless girls!" She punished them at once. For a time, the water in the bath splashed everywhere. The two handmaidens dared not fight back and could only beg for mercy. After the playful antics, Hong Mian spoke earnestly, "Mountain Chieftain, let me tell you a secret. The Manor Head once privately asked the two of us to ask questions." Qin Weiwei, exposing her fair arms for them to wipe, immediately became curious. "What did he ask you?" Lu Liu snickered and replied, "The Manor Head asked us if you have any preferred men. He said if you do, tell him immediately, and he'll try to arrange something discreetly for you." Qin Weiwei's cheeks flushed again, and she spat. "My father's so incorrigible! How can he put so much effort into meddling in such things and not concern himself with important matters?! "The next time he asks, tell him that I'm not looking for anyone, and being single is just fine for me!" Hong Mian chuckled, "We wouldn't dare to say that to the Manor Head.  If we did, he might think we're instigating trouble. It would be better to wait until after you find a suitor  that we give him a proper response." "I won't find a suitor!" Qin Weiwei sneered, "What's so good about men? They're nothing but a bunch of jack*sses!" She glanced to her left and right before continuing, "Fortunately, you guys followed me. If you followed a man, look at their faces when they treat their handmaidens. Handmaidens? They always ultimately become concubines. Just thinking about it makes me sick!" Lu Liu discreetly stuck out her tongue, not daring to reply, for Qin Weiwei had even criticized the Manor Head. Hong Mian smiled. "Wait a little longer, then, Mountain Chieftain. We'll keep an eye out for someone who meets your standards and isn't the type to sleep with handmaidens." "You shameless girl! Are you both in heat? Shall I send you two to serve as concubines?" Qin Weiwei coldly snorted, threatening them. Then, she changed the topic and asked, "Is there anything going on outside?" Getting to the matter at hand, Hong Mian's smile faded as she spoke seriously, "Nothing significant. East Arrival Cave sent an urgent memorial overnight. The messenger is still waiting in the mountain for your instructions and response." "East Arrival Cave? That guy just went there, and he's already submitted a memorial?! He's not trying to brush me off, is he?" Thinking of Miao Yi, Qin Weiwei's tone turned unpleasant. She turned and said, "Bring the memorial over." "Yes!" Lu Liu quickly got up and left the bath. After wiping herself off, she wrapped herself in a long robe and quickly left. Not long after, she returned with a sealed box containing the memorial and opened it on the spot, placing it beside the pool. Qin Weiwei let her lustrous black hair cascade over her snowy white shoulders, leaning against the pool's edge. Upon reaching into the box... Why are there so many memorials? Did that guy write a long poem or something? She took out a jade archive, infused it with her powers, and checked the memorial. After finishing one, she quickly moved on to the next. As she progressed, her expression shifted from surprise to confusion. After reading through them, she thought she must have made a mistake and rechecked them meticulously. Unsure whether to believe it, she reviewed them again to see if they had been tampered with. Finally, placing the jade archive by the edge of the pool, Qin Weiwei frowned, her brows occasionally creasing in confusion and disbelief. She muttered to herself, "What on earth is that guy up to...." Hong Mian and Lu Liu, who didn't dare to disturb the Mountain Chieftain's official duties, could tell that something was wrong. They also didn't know what memorials Miao Yi, the Cave Master, had written that would leave her in such a state. Nonetheless, she didn't seem angry! Hong Mian and Lu Liu exchanged glances and noticed the substantial number of jade archives and memorials. It seemed that the memorials from East Arrival Cave outnumbered those submitted by the Cave Masters from various sects of Mount Calming Sea combined. Chapter 77 Qin Weiwei Was Bewildered (2) After waiting for a while and seeing that Qin Weiwei remained lost in thought without reacting, Hong Mian gently inquired, "Mountain Chieftain, did something happen in East Arrival Cave?" As Qin Weiwei snapped back to reality, her thoughts remained jumbled. She didn't know what to say, so she raised her hand slightly and said, "Take a look. Help me analyze what exactly is going on at East Arrival Cave." Because of their status as handmaidens, they wouldn't dare to read such documents without the Mountain Chieftain's permission. Seeing how perplexed Qin Weiwei looked, Hong Mian and Lu Liu were also curious about the contents of the jade archives. Now that they were granted permission, they eagerly picked up the jade archives to examine them. The more they read, the more bewildered they, too, became. After exchanging jade archives to read, both women clearly shared the same doubts as Qin Weiwei. Worried they might be forgeries, the pair checked them over again, two times. However, the ten memorials were obviously written by ten people with distinct magic power. The signature seals were impossible to imitate, just like fingerprints. Ultimately, Lu Liu, clutching a jade archive in her arms, mumbled blankly, "That Cave Master Miao sure is something! He subdued the entire East Arrival Cave's subordinates in a single night!" Qin Weiwei, lost in thought, rolled her eyes at the remark. She turned around and mocked, "With his cultivation, do you think it's possible?" Hong Mian muttered, "It is indeed a little strange!" The two of them had been by Qin Weiwei's side for a long time, so they were aware of the current situation in South Edict Manor. To Manor Head Yang Qing, bringing the School of Blue Jade under their jurisdiction was like inviting an enemy in. In fact, Yang Qing wasn't initially eager to rebel. He had intended to gradually accumulate strength. However, the former Manor Head, Lu Yu, couldn't allow Yang Qing to grow too powerful. Lu Yu issued an edict to transfer Yang Qing to his side, attempting to control him. Yang Qing knew that once he went to Lu Yu's side, Lu Yu would never give him another chance to stand out. It was precisely because of Lu Yu's actions that Yang Qing was forced to make a decisive move. He agreed to cooperate with the School of Blue Jade, overthrowing Lu Yu and seizing South Edict Manor. While Yang Qing and the School of Blue Jade both benefited individually, they were aware of certain underlying issues. The School of Blue Jade knew that Yang Qing wasn't someone content with being subordinate. He would find a way to sever the School of Blue Jade's influence over the South Edict Manor. Likewise, Yang Qing knew that although the School of Blue Jade wouldn't act recklessly right now, once they established a connection through this alliance, they would likely attempt to replace Yang Qing in the future. Yang Qing's willingness to rebel stemmed from his years of cultivating connections within the system. He had people speaking on his behalf around the Hall Master. Without that, even if he captured South Edict Manor, without recognition from the Hall Master, it wouldn't really belong to him. He might even end up being labeled a rebel. The School of Blue Jade did not dare to act rashly, and what they lacked was precisely this network of connections. They did not dare to go against the enormous power of the system. However, if their relationship was straightened out, the number of people under the control of the School of Blue Jade in South Edict Manor was more than that of Yang Qing. If they decided to confront Yang Qing, Yang Qing would have difficulty resisting. Both sides understood that their cooperation was temporary, lasting at most fifty years. After that, they might have to break ties. It would come down to who had the upper hand. In short, it was a balance of power. Because Yang Qing was short on people, although the main positions of South Edict Manor were controlled by their own people, the more minor positions were almost all occupied by the School of Blue Jade. Not just other sects, but even Mount Calming Sea was facing the same situation. Qin Weiwei, in her role as Mountain Chieftain, was similarly dealing with School of Blue Jade members beneath her who didn't follow orders straightforwardly. However, since she was Yang Qing's goddaughter, the School of Blue Jade disciples under her command didn't openly defy her. They were somewhat forced to show respect to Yang Qing. Yet, the Cave Masters under Qin Weiwei didn't enjoy this same privilege. The memorials they sent complained about the School of Blue Jade members' double-dealing behaviors, making things difficult. Nine of the Cave Masters under her sent petitions full of grievances. Ironically, the weakest Cave Master, who held a First Grade White Lotuis cultivation, sent the only good news. Upon taking office, this particular Cave Master had slain a School of Blue Jade disciple with a Third Grade White Lotus cultivation. Originally, this could have ignited a conflict between the School of Blue Jade and Yang Qing. But lo and behold, the School of Blue Jade unanimously accused the person named Song Fu of deserving his fate, listing his various transgressions. They unequivocally condemned him, wholeheartedly supporting the actions of the Cave Master. No doubt the School of Blue Jade would have no objections even if they clearly did. That said, the good news didn't make Qin Weiwei happy but bewildered instead. That b*stard had only just arrived; how could he have managed to turn the entire East Arrival Cave into an ironclad stronghold overnight?! Especially with School of Blue Jade disciples rallying closely around the Great Cave Master Miao... What kind of joke was this? Just thinking about it made her feel nauseous. What was this? Was this a slap in the faces to the other nine Cave Masters or to her, the Mountain Chieftain, Qin Weiwei? Were they implying that they were all less capable than Cave Master Miao? Was her initial decision to prevent Cave Master Miao from going to East Arrival Cave a foolish one? But if it was all fabricated, their testimonies couldn't be counterfeited! Could the person named Song Fu really be so despicable? But how despicable could he be to make all the School of Blue Jade disciples despise him? Qin Weiwei shook her head slightly, feeling that something was amiss. No matter how hateful Song Fu was, the School of Blue Jade disciples couldn't possibly submit memorials to condemn him and express their support for Great Cave Master Miao. That b*stard had just gone, and his cultivation was so low. Where did he get such prestige so quickly? If someone mentioned that he had impressed them with some sort of awe-inspiring aura, Qin Weiwei wouldn't believe it, even if she was beaten to death. Hong Mian and Lu Liu also locked their brows into a tight furrow, looking absolutely bewildered. "Enough with the bath. Dress me and summon the messenger over!" With a splash, Qin Weiwei rose from the water and stepped ashore. She used magic to create a burst of mist around her ivory-like body, making the water droplets on her skin vanish instantly. The two handmaidens immediately helped her dress. Her hair was styled into a bun, held together by six snow-white jade hairpins arranged like a butterfly, securing the bun at the back of her head. Inside the great hall of Mount Calming Sea, Mountain Chieftain Qin Weiwei sat loftily on her throne, her delicate and cold countenance on display. Dan Biaoyi, standing below the platform, turned panicked from all the questions he had been asked. However, no matter what Qin Weiwei asked, he insisted that Song Fu did not obey the Cave Master's orders and destroyed the mountain gate. He was also rude to the Cave Master, so he was killed by the Cave Master as a warning to others. Qin Weiwei did not have much doubt about the possibility of Miao Yi killing a White Lotus Third Grade cultivator. She had also seen the battle at Transient Light Cave and also heard about Miao Yi removing the ghost cultivators. Two White Lotus Third Grade cultivators died during the mission, and he was the only one who returned alive. Therefore, it was entirely possible for Miao Yi to kill Song Fu. However, she was no fool. He couldn't have so simply have all the East Arrival Cave and School of Blue Jade disciples submit statements to absolve Miao Yi of responsibility, could he? "Dan Biaoyi, are you sure you are not hiding anything from me?" Qin Weiwei stared at the man below and snorted coldly. As someone from the lower echelons, Dan Biaoyi was unaware of the power struggles at the higher levels. He only knew that he had been involved in the killing of Song Fu. Once he admitted to it, aside from East Arrival Cave not tolerating him, the members of the School of Blue Jade would seek revenge, especially considering that it involved obtaining multiple Orbs of Will. Therefore, he could not possibly tell the truth. Dan Biaoyi staunchly maintained his claim, leaving Qin Weiwei somewhat helpless. She had a vague sense that East Arrival Cave seemed to have truly been turned into an ironclad stronghold overnight by that b*stard. It couldn't possibly be that the b*stard was just incredibly lucky, stumbling upon a group of fanatically loyal group, right? That would be a load of nonsense! Chapter 78 Qin Weiwei Was Bewildered (3) "You can leave now!" Qin Weiwei dismissed Dan Biaoyi coldly. After Dan Biaoyi left, Hong Mian asked, "Mountain Chieftain, should we report this matter to Manor Head?" "With the current situation still unclear, how can I haphazardly report it?" Qin Weiwei shook her head, rejecting the idea, and immediately ordered Lu Liu to fetch a School of Blue Jade disciple. Soon after, a School of Blue Jade disciple entered the great hall and paid his respects to Qin Weiwei, who then asked, "Do you know a fellow disciple named Song Fu?" "Song Fu?" The person was stunned. He didn't know what had happened, but he still nodded and said, "I do." Qin Weiwei asked again, "What can you tell me about his character?" The person was once again taken aback. He didn't know why the Mountain Chieftain would ask him such questions, but he still cupped his fists and replied, "Junior Brother Song is an honest person. He respects his teachers and has impeccable character!" He didn't care what happened to Song Fu or about his relationship with him. But when facing outsiders, it was natural to uphold the reputation of the sect and his fellow disciples. With the situation unclear, speaking positively about his fellow disciple was certainly the right move. After dismissing him, Qin Weiwei pointed at the departing figure and said to Hong Mian and Lu Liu, who were standing to her left and right, "Do you see that? This is what fellow disciples of the same sect should say, not like the people of East Arrival Cave. That doesn't make sense at all!" Hong Mian asked, "Mountain Chieftain, what do you plan to do?" Qin Weiwei suddenly stood up and said, "Seeing is believing. I'll take a trip to East Arrival Cave and see if the disciples there truly revere our great Cave Master Miao! If he dares to stir up any trouble and mess up the current situation, I won't spare him!" Lu Liu asked tentatively, "What if they genuinely support him?" Qin Weiwei insisted, "That's impossible. There's definitely something fishy going on. If they genuinely support him, I'll gladly hand over my position as Mountain Chieftain to him. "If he truly has such capabilities, let him deal with the School of Blue Jade disciples here at Mount Calming Sea. It would also save the Manor Head some trouble! Hong Mian and Lu Liu exchanged glances and stuck their tongues out. They knew the Mountain Chieftain was only venting her frustrations and couldn't be taken seriously right then. However, tfor someone who had just assumed the position, immediately conducting an inspection seemed a little... Not long after, Dan Biaoyi, who had received his reply, could finally return to East Arrival Cave. However, he couldn't relax. Instead, he remained on edge throughout the journey, for Mountain Chieftain Qin Weiwei had led a group of people on the same trip! The Cave Master had just assumed his position, and the Mountain Chieftain had already been summoned. Sigh... Dan Biaoyi sighed inwardly, praying to the heavens for protection, hoping that the Cave Master would arrange everything carefully and avoid any slip-ups. Some treacherous ships were hard to get off once aboard. Though there might be holes everywhere, even though it might be leaking, those on board still needed to row forward together. If they stopped rowing, they would drown, but if they rowed forward, there would still be a glimmer of hope. Miao Yi also couldn't discern the complexities between Yang Qing and the School of Blue Jade. That was the state the people at the bottom were in. There was nothing he could do. Moreover, he didn't have much knowledge since he had just recently surrendered to Yang Qing. From his standpoint, he was the legitimate Cave Master of East Arrival Cave, and the disciples of East Arrival Cave should naturally obey him. If he didn't, he would have to deal with them immediately. He couldn't possibly let it drag on, could he? It was only reasonable for him to quickly grasp the entire East Arrival Cave firmly in his hands. Otherwise, what was the point of him being the Cave Master? Alas, little did he know that by quickly taking control of the entire East Arrival Cave, he had actually caused unease higher up. However, not knowing had its benefits; at least, it saved him from worrying for the time being. Right then, Miao Yi strolled leisurely through the streets of East Arrival City in his brocade clothes. Zhu Tianbiao was still as introverted as ever. He wouldn't speak unless someone spoke to him. Occasionally, when he tried to flatter, it wasn't very convincing. He only followed behind, holding a treasured sword, like a bodyguard. Miao Yi had brought him out to be a bodyguard, to begin with, given that he was a White Lotus Third Grade cultivator. If anything happened, he could provide some defense. On the side of the road, there was a colorful building with a lively crowd gathered around it. A noble lady was throwing an embroidered ball, drawing Miao Yi and Zhu Tianbiao's attention as they walked past. However, they didn't linger. The young lady on the balcony held the embroidered ball, her shy expression revealing her anticipation as she searched the crowd for her beloved. Her gaze quickly locked onto Miao Yi as he passed by. Right then, Miao Yi wasn't exactly the most outstanding man around, but being young and newly appointed as a Cave Master, he exuded a certain air of confidence. Coupled with the aura of a cultivator, his presence was beyond that of an ordinary young man. Furthermore, he had a bodyguard accompanying him. Just by looking, it was evident that he held a significant status. The young lady bit her lip, exerting force in her arms as she threw the embroidered ball. It was quite forceful and accurate. She was indeed a daring lady to throw the ball. She might have practiced it a few times, as throwing it at an old man would have been quite problematic. As the embroidered ball flew out, the crowd below reached out to snatch it, but it went flying over their heads. Miao Yi continued walking forward without even glancing at it. He waved his hand, and the embroidered ball flew back toward the balcony. Zhu Tianbiao merely tilted his head to take a look. Silently, he followed behind Miao Yi, brushing past the crowd on the side. The young lady on the balcony stared in astonishment, holding the returned embroidered ball in her arms. She watched the two men who walked away unhurriedly and muttered, stunned. For a young lady, this was quite embarrassing—she had thrown the ball, and it was thrown back to her. It was simply unheard of. The crowd below was also flabbergasted. One by one, they tiptoed as they watched the two people gradually disappear into the distance. Then, they turned around and shouted loudly, "Young Miss, throw it again. Young Miss, throw it again." However, the young lady gritted her teeth and turned her head away, disappearing into the embroidery building. In East Arrival City, a river cut across its expanse. After Zhu Tianbiao inquired about the boat fare from a moored boatman, he and Miao Yi both boarded the covered small boat. The boatman rowed, carrying them along the river's current. Miao Yi stood at the bow with his hands behind his back, while Zhu Tianbiao held his sword behind him. The small boat hadn't traveled far when the sound of horse hooves came from the shore. People on the boat turned to look, only to see the young lady who had thrown the embroidery ball leading several burly men on horseback, chasing after them. "Stop right there!" shouted the young lady as she pointed at Miao Yi, who was standing at the bow of the ship. Miao Yi looked around and, taking advantage of the lack of people's attention, used his cultivation to manifest a lotus flower illusion on his forehead, hoping it would deter the pursuers. To his surprise, the pursuers continued to chase without hesitation, apparently not afraid of a cultivator. Amidst his astonishment, Miao Yi suddenly realized that he had used Spirit Concealing Clay to hide the lotus flower illusion on his forehead, making it invisible to others. The guy had gotten addicted to using this thing. The reason was simple: his cultivation was a bit too low, and even as a Cave Master, he was afraid of being looked down upon. He decided to hide the lotus flower illusion on his forehead, lest it become a laughingstock. As such, he had to discreetly communicate this to Zhu Tianbiao. Zhu Tianbiao swiftly turned around and stared coldly at the young lady. The lotus flower on his forehead was revealed, immediately shocking the young lady and her companions. They stopped their horses and did not dare to act rashly. The young lady's daydream was shattered, and she realized why the other party had treated her with disdain. She felt the vast difference between them and couldn't help but feel aggrieved, biting her lip... To Miao Yi, it was merely a minor incident. Chapter 79 Qin Weiwei Was Bewildered (4) On both sides of the river, there were willow trees and one could occasionally find women squatting on the banks, washing vegetables and clothes. There were also rows of brothels, where young ladies stood at the railings, waving handkerchiefs and sweetly beckoning to attract passersby on boats. Further ahead, by the river bank, groups of young men recited poetry, hoping to attract the attention of strolling girls in groups. The young girls, however, blushed and secretly stole glances at the young man standing on the bow of the covered boat. As the flower boat brushed past the covered boat, the heavily made-up proprietresses loudly invited the dashing young man on the boat to join them for a flower wine. In the taverns above, wealthy patrons called for friends and engaged in drinking bouts, raising their cups in hearty toasts. On the shores, vendors and laborers bustled about, and children chased and played with each other. Living by the water was a human instinct. Traveling by boat, they were able to fully appreciate the prosperity of East Arrival City. The people in this world, though required to contribute six hours of their wish power each day and pay taxes, gained the protection of cultivators in return. These cultivators vanquished demons, expelled malevolent spirits, and ensured the safety of the land. Even the Six Sages of Heaven and Earth relied on the efforts of cultivators spread across various regions to accumulate wish power. Without this, their formidable strength would be insufficient to oversee such vast territories. It was precisely because of the existence of these cultivators that the powerful officials did not dare to excessively pressure believers and disrupt the collection of wish power. Cultivators would be the first to intervene if anything went wrong. Although cultivators would not often appear openly, they had unquestionably stabilized the world's order. Of course, not everyone along the riverbanks had to contribute six hours of wish power each day like commoners. Those with power and influence could delegate tasks to places like the Manor of Merciful Hope and even hire others to do the work for them. So, the hard workers continued to toil, while those who indulged themselves weren't affected. The law of life dictated that some people were busy while others were idle. In any case, for Miao Yi, who was standing at the bow of the boat, this was his domain. Seeing his followers living contentedly and worrying less about whether they could contribute the Orbs of Will by the end of the year allowed him to temporarily set aside his concerns. As the night fell, Dan Biaoyi, riding his dragon steed, felt a mix of anxiety and anticipation under the stars and moon as he approached East Arrival Cave With the entrance to East Arrival Cave in sight, Dan Biaoyi gritted his teeth and sped up a little behind Qin Weiwei. He clasped his fists and said, "Mountain Chieftain, I will immediately head to the manor to inform the Cave Master to welcome you." In reality, he wanted to give everyone a heads-up and let the Cave Master be mentally prepared. Qin Weiwei glanced back at him and coldly huffed, "No need." Then, she gave orders to the people behind her who were riding swiftly, "Watch him closely. Don't give him any chance to send a message. I want to see what the hell East Arrival Cave is up to!" Dan Biaoyi's heart skipped a beat. Two White Lotus Third Grade cultivators had swiftly caught up and flanked him. The group of five rushed straight through the entrance of East Arrival Cave under the moonlight, their speed as fast as lightning. Shang Youlai, who was guarding the entrance, emerged from the shadows and blocked the entrance. He pointed his spear to the distance and shouted sternly," Dismount!" His booming voice echoed, also serving as an alert to others in the cave. With the alarm sounded, those who were practicing in their respective manors swiftly emerged, sprinting toward the Hidden Dragon Valley. Six figures armed with weapons and riding six dragon steeds raced to the scene to prepare for any unforeseen circumstances. Qin Weiwei wasn't the type to barge in and violate the rules. She raised her hand to stop the people behind her. Leading a group of five, they urgently brought their dragon steeds under control, stopping in front of the mountain gate. Had it been ordinary people, they would have been instantly thrown out. On the other side of the mountain gate, another six dragon steeds quickly gathered and approached aggressively. Qin Weiwei was somewhat surprised. She hadn't expected East Arrival Cave to react so quickly. This efficiency was extraordinary. That was because Miao Yi had already said that if the mountain gate was smashed again, he would have to settle accounts with Wang Zifa. Miao Yi had also mentioned that if they didn't cooperate, not a single Orb of Will would be given, and they would also be expelled. What other caves other than this one were willing to provide such a high treatment?! Besides, Miao Yi had a hold on them all. Everyone should be diligent in their work to avoid Miao Yi's scrutiny. Seeing that it was Mountain Chieftain Qin Weiwei, Shang Youlai immediately shut up and cupped his fists in greeting. Yan Xiu and others who had urgently arrived to prevent any mishaps exchanged glances and quickly dismounted. They walked briskly to the front of the mountain gate, bowing with clasped fists to show their respect. Many people glanced at Dan Biaoyi, who accompanied Qin Weiwei, seemingly blaming him for not giving them the heads-up for the Mountain Chieftain's arrival. Some even secretly transmitted their voices to ask Dan Biaoyi. However, the man was stuck in a difficult position. The two by his let and right had made interferences to prevent him from sending any messages. They used their magic to disrupt his communication. Qin Weiwei raised her head to look at the plaque above the gate and snorted coldly, "They've built this plaque even more grandly than South Edict Manor!" Everyone could tell that she had come with ill intentions, and none of them knew what to say. Qin Weiwei scanned the crowd, then led her group to ride their dragon steeds directly through the entrance and headed for the main hall where they eventually dismounted. Dan Biaoyi was held hostage as he followed Qin Weiwei into the hall. The main hall was empty, so Qin Weiwei headed straight for the rear courtyard where the Cave Master resided. Charcoal lay leisurely at the door in the rear courtyard, wagging its tail. Its tail would occasionally tap on the ground lightly. When he opened his eyes and saw Qin Weiwei, he immediately widened his eyes and sprang up. He seemed to be at a loss as to where to hide. With no other choice, Charcoal sprang up several dozen meters high and landed outside the courtyard, quickly fleeing. That beast! Qin Weiwei wondered, both angry and amused. Am I that scary? Although she didn't like Charcoal, she still wouldn't rush to her subordinate's house overnight and slaughter his mount. She wasn't that disgraceful to do something that petty. Without spotting any trace of Miao Yi outside, Qin Weiwei barged into his living quarters unannounced. She searched high and low but still couldn't find him. After exiting the room, she looked left and right and saw light coming from a room aside. Immediately, she walked over and kicked open the door with a bang. To her surprise, she found two attractive handmaidens dressed in revealing clothes. They were startled and clung to each other, trembling as they looked at Qin Weiwei, who had barged in. Clearly, these handmaidens were under Miao Yi's care, residing in the cave master's quarters. Qin Weiwei glanced at her own handmaiden, Hong Mian, who had been following her the entire time. Her eyes were filled with ridicule, as if she was saying, 'You see, men are all the same.' Hong Mian smiled without saying a word. This time, only she had accompanied Qin Weiwei. Lu Liu did not come. After searching the room and not finding Miao Yi, Qin Weiwei turned to the two frightened handmaidens and asked coldly, "Where's your Cave Master?" The two handmaidens shook their heads in silence. "Hmph!" Qin Weiwei didn't bother herself with the two handmaidens. She flung her hands dismissively and led her men back to the main hall. She directly ascended the high seat, occupied the spot belonging to Miao Yi, and stared at the entrance, shouting, "Yan Xiu!" Promptly, Yan Xiu, among the people outside the main hall, ran in, behaving deferentially. Chapter 80 Dragged Out and Beheaded Qin Weiwei asked, "Where did Miao Yi go?" Yan Xiu smiled apologetically. "The Cave Master has gone to patrol the territory." Qin Weiwei was stunned, realizing that the fellow was quite confident in leaving the affairs of the cave as soon as he arrived, just to go on an inspection. "When is he coming back?" she asked again. "Um..." Yan Xiu shook his head. "I don't know when the Cave Master will return." Qin Weiwei snorted coldly. "Find him and bring him to me immediately, then!" Yan Xiu was immediately on the verge of tears. "But sMountain Chieftain, the entire East Arrival Cave is so big..." He didn't dare to finish his sentence. The implication was evident: Where were they to look for the Cave Master in such a vast territory?! Qin Weiwei realized that she might be putting them in a difficult position. As such, she didn't dwell on this matter and began calling people in one by one to ask about Song Fu's death and their written condemnation. "Did Miao Yi use some method to threaten you guys?" "Why do you say that, Mountain Chieftain? The Cave Master definitely did not threaten us. We just can't stand how arrogant Song Fu was. Even though we were from the same sect, we couldn't tolerate his behavior..." Even when Qin Weiwei sealed Dan Biaoyi's mouth, it didn't make a difference. No matter how she approached the matter, whether through insinuations, threats, or temptations, everyone was tight-lipped about anything other than condemning Song Fun. They were firmly standing up for Miao Yi, leaving Qin Weiwei frustrated. If only the entire Mount Calming Sea was like this. Unfortunately, there was only one East Arrival Cave. Clearly, there was something fishy going on here, but whether it was the people she personally dispatched like Yan Xiu or members of the School of Blue Jade, they were all united like a fortress, refusing to divulge any information. Qin Weiwei decided to settle the score with Miao Yi when he returned. Unfortunately, three days had passed without Miao Yi's return. She had no idea when that guy would be back. What frustrated her the most was that even when the Cave Master was away, his subordinates continued to maintain the affairs of East Arrival Cave in an orderly manner. Unlike in the other caves where the School of Blue Jade disciples were reluctant to guard the mountain gate and perform menial tasks, that was not the case in East Arrival Cave. instead, Miao Yi's trusted subordinates, including Yan Xiu, were spared from these tasks, and all responsibilities were carried out by the loyal disciples of the School of Blue Jade. Moreover, the attitude of Wang Zifa and the others toward Yan Xiu. was notably respectful, which indicated their attitude toward the Great Cave Master Miao. Look at the Great Cave Master Miao. He managed to organize East Arrival Cave to such an extent overnight, gaining a high reputation among the members. On the other hand, the people she appointed personally seemed to struggle in managing their respective caves. They came to her one by one, complaining about their difficulties. Meanwhile, the guy she didn't want to appoint ended up managing things perfectly. It couldn't be any more ironic. This almost made the quietly observing Qin Weiwei almost choke on her own blood. Could it be that she was projecting her own doubts onto others? They were currently in turbulent times, and she couldn't stay here indefinitely either. Who knew when would Miao Yi eventually return?! After waiting for three days, she finally left with her men. No one knew what she had in mind, but either way, she took Dan Biaoyi with her as well. This left the people who were seeing them off at the gate, including Yan Xiu, extremely anxious. They exchanged meaningful glances with Dan Biaoyi as if saying, "Hang in there, my friend!" Everyone was clear that once Dan Biaoyi couldn't withstand the pressure and spilled the beans, it wouldn't just be about whether they could obtain the Orbs of Will from Cave Master Miao. Most importantly, the School of Blue Jade would not let them off. After all, Yan Xiu and his companions had killed a School of Blue Jade disciple. And the other School of Blue Jade disciples had committed an act akin to betraying their sect. With the current situation, the School of Blue Jade disciples were gripped with fear and regret, lamenting their decision to get involved. They were now facing Qin Weiwei's offers of substantial rewards, yet they didn't dare disembark the ship they had board, frantically bailing water together, struggling not to sink in that leaky vessel, and refusing to turn back to shore. Noticing the expressions of everyone around her, Qin Weiwei's cold face became even more certain that there was something fishy going on. Hong Mian glanced at her mistress and couldn't help stifling a laugh. She thought to herself that regardless of whether there was any trickery involved, the fact that they were united like this clearly indicated that Cave Master Miao had indeed managed to organize them well. No wonder he had the confidence to leave the cave's affairs behind and wander around. If other. Cave Masters shared his ability, things at Mount Calming Sea would be much easier to handle. She just wasn't sure if her mistress meant it when she said she would give up her position as the Mountain Chieftain to Miao Yi if he genuinely gained the support of those under him... Qin Weiwei evidently grasped her thoughts and gave her a stern glare. She couldn't believe her handmaiden would consider her words, which she huffed out of frustration, seriously. Upon swiftly returning to Mount Calming Sea, Qin Weiwei didn't rest. After checking if there were any urgent matters, she immediately brought Dan Biaoyi to South Edict Manor. The fact that Yang Qing's personally appointed subordinate had killed a School of Blue Jade disciple couldn't be kept hidden forever. It would be brought to light sooner or later, and while it remained uncertain whether the School of Blue Jade would react, they would at least ask about it. Qin Weiwei had to personally report the details to make sure Yang Qing was well-prepared. Upon learning that they were heading to South Edict Manor again, Dan Biaoyi began feeling uneasy. Why has the matter seemingly snowballed? Is it necessary? The people at the lower levels were unaware of the affairs at the higher levels, and the complex hidden struggles involved. If they had known, they might not have dared to act as they did. After arriving at South Edict Manor, Qin Weiwei did not need to announce her presence before meeting Yang Qing. She followed Qing Ju to a pavilion at the highest peak of the back mountain and found Yang Qing meditating and cultivating. "Qin Weiwei pays her respects to the Manor Head!" Qin Weiwei, dressed in a snowy white, saluted. In the presence of others, Qin Weiwei always maintained the demeanor of a subordinate with Yang Qing, only using more familiar terms privately. Yang Qing ended his meditation, and after opening his eyes, he exhaled an Orb of Will the size of a quail egg. He smiled and said, "What brings you here, Weiwei?" He rose from his seat, walked to the tea table, and sat down. He gestured for her to sit and speak. "Is there something you need?" "Manor Head, I'm afraid the Cave Master of East Arrival Cave that you personally appointed has caused you trouble." Qin Weiwei sat down on a chair on the other side of the tea table. Yang Qing replied with an 'oh' and frowned slightly. "Miao Yi? What did he do?" "Manor Head, take a look yourself." Qin Weiwei placed the box containing the memorial she had brought in front of him. After Yang Qing opened and read the memorial, he, too, be came bewildered. As Qing Mei and Qing Ju exchanged glances, Yang Qing quickly rechecked and reviewed the jade archives one after another. Being a composed person, he didn't react as dramatically as Qin Weiwei had initially. He only asked curiously, "Weiwei, what's going on?" "I don't know what happened either. In order to verify this matter, I specially made a trip to East Arrival Cave. But Miao Yi had gone out to inspect his territory..." Qin Weiwei detailed the situation she had witnessed. After listening, Yang Qing tapped his gently on the table. He pondered for a long time before shaking his head; He couldn't figure it out either. Ultimately, he said, "Summon the person you brought with you. I will question him personally." Dan Biaoyi was quickly summoned. Facing someone as superior as Yang Qing for the first time and harboring a guilty conscience, he was extremely nervous. However, there was one thing he was consistent about: no matter how Yang Qing questioned him, he reiterated the same story. Yang Qing didn't beat around the bush like Qin Weiwei did. He got up,  slowly walked to the railing of the pavilion, and gazed at the distant mountain scenery. He clasped hands behind his back expressionlessly and monotoned,"Drag him out and behead him!" In an instant, Qing Mei and Qing Ju sprang into action, each grabbing a shoulder of Dan Biaoyi and immobilizing him, dragging him out without hesitation. Chapter 81 Confess This wasn't a joke. Qing Mei and Qing Ju both had a cultivation of White Lotus Seventh Grade. When they attacked together, Dan Biaoyi, a mere White Lotus Second Grade cultivator, would have no chance to resist. He was captured just like that, with no way of fighting. Qin Weiwei glanced silently at Dan Biaoyi, who was being dragged away. Miao Yi was someone Yang Qing personally appointed, after all. She'd have to give Yang Qing due respect even if she snubbed Miao Yi. She couldn't commit indiscriminate killings of kill Miao Yi's subordinates without any evidence. However, Yang Qing could do it, and no one could say anything even if he did. Dan Biaoyi was stunned for a moment. By the time he came around, he realized that he had already been forcefully dragged out of the pavilion. He was instantly scared out of his wits. He knew that Yang Qing might be trying to scare him, mainly to extract information. However, he also knew that Yang Qing had already spoken. If he did not give Yang Qing a satisfactory answer, Yang Qing would not change his mind for the sake of someone as insignificant as him. Killing him was nothing to Yang Qing. "I was wrong, Manor Head. I'll say it. Please give me another chance. I'll say it, Manor Head. I'll say it." Dan Biaoyi, who was dragged out of the pavilion, struggled and cried out for mercy, his face pale with fright. Yang Qing, gazing at the distant mountains from the railing, did not turn his head. He only extended a hand from behind and raised it slightly. Qing Mei and Qing Ju looked at each other and released Dan Biaoyi. The frightened Dan Biaoyi panicked and stumbled into the pavilion. He knelt behind Yang Qing and said with a pale face, "I'll say it, Manor Head!" With his back turned, Yang Qing calmly inquired, "Why did the members of the School of Blue Jade collectively accuse Song Fu?" "They were all... "They were all coerced by Cave Master Miao!" Dan Biaoyi confessed with great difficulty. If Miao Yi continued to be the Cave Master of East Arrival Cave after this incident, there might not be a place anymore for him in East Arrival Cave. Qing Mei and Qing Ju listened attentively. Qin Weiwei's gaze also flickered, wondering if the mystery would finally be revealed. Anyone could guess that the School of Blue Jade disciples had undoubtedly faced some sort of pressure. They just didn't know what method Miao Yi had used to suppress them. "Speak of the whole story in detail!" Yang Qing instructed calmly, his tone unperturbed. Despite Yang Qing's back being turned to Dan Biaoyi and his tone calm, Dan Biaoyi was freaking out, for he knew that if the slightest inconsistency was detected, Yang Qing could decide his fate in an instant, leaving him with no chance of resistance. "Manor Head, it's true that the School of Blue Jade's disciples were disrespectful first. But they already refused to disobey the commands of those in charge before Cave Master Miao even arrived at East Arrival Cave. Instead, they were insubordinate in every turn, creating fiction. However, they have the numbers, so we can't do anything to them. "On the day Cave Master Miao took office, he found no one guarding the mountain gate of East Arrival Cave. In a fit of anger..." Dan Biaoyi honestly recounted the events. From the moment Yan Xiu and the others rushed to the gate upon hearing the commotion, Miao Yi thundered why was no one guarding the East Arrival Cave entrance. Yan Xiu complained about the School of Blue Jade. The School of Blue Jade's disciples, including Song Fu, arrived late and even ridiculed Miao Yi. Hearing that, Yang Qing, with his back to the crowd, narrowed his eyes slightly as a glint of coldness flashed in his gaze. He had sent Miao Yi, and everyone knew that Miao Yi was his confidant. Imagine what it would be like elsewhere when the School of Blue Jade dared even to disrespect his confidant. "How did your Cave Master deal with it back then?" Yang Qing asked indifferently. Dan Biaoyi immediately responded, "The Cave Master didn't hesitate to order his subordinates to rush to Mount Calming Sea and report to the Mountain Chieftain, claiming that the School of Blue Jade had rebelled. This frightened the School of Blue Jade disciples, and after some struggle, they reluctantly pay their respects to Cave Master Miao. However, Cave Master Miao didn't bother to entertain them one bit. He immediately ordered Song Fu, a White Lotus Third Grade cultivator, to guard the mountain gate. Regardless of whether Song Fu agreed or not, he immediately rode his dragon steed and charged at them!" Standing with his hands behind his back, Yang Qing's lips curved into a faint smile. He could imagine how arrogant Miao Yi must've been at the time, not giving any quarter, and completely disregarding the members of the School of Blue Jade. This was exactly the kind of confidence he expected from his personally appointed confidant, which elevated his own status. "What happened next? How did Song Fu end up dead?" Yang Qing asked. "Actually, the Cave Master didn't kill Song Fu, but it was Yan Xiu, Qiu Shaoqun, and I who did it." At this point, Dan Biaoyi didn't hold back any longer and continued to narrate the story. He said that Miao Yi had gathered the three of them to discuss. He accurately predicted that Song Fu would be insubordinate and wouldn't guard the mountain gate. Thus, he ordered Qiu Shaoqun to secretly damage their mountain gate, preparing to take the opportunity to confront Song Fu. At that time, everyone felt the matter was of great importance and feared it might cause trouble. However, Miao Yi insisted on using Song Fu as a scapegoat. After Qiu Shaoqun smashed the mountain gate and caused a commotion, Miao Yi took the opportunity to flip out. After dispersing the School of Blue Jade disciples, he summoned Song Fu to East Arrival Grand Hall for questioning. When Song Fu refused to admit guilty, Yan Xiu, Dan Biaoyi, and Qiu Shaoqun, who had secretly returned as per their plan, launched an attack on Miao Yi's command, killing Song Fu within the grand hall. Following that, Miao Yi coerced and enticed the School of Blue Jade disciples, forcing them to write a memorandum and demanding that the School of Blue Jade disciples rebuild the mountain gate overnight. He also described how they, fearing repercussions, collectively tried to placate Qin Weiwei. After finishing his account, Dan Biaoyi bowed his head and said, "That's how things transpired." Qing Mei and Qing Ju exchanged glances. They realized they had underestimated Cave Master Miao. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that he was both wise and brave. It had only been a few hours since they had arrived at East Arrival Cave, yet he had already used thunderous methods to make the entire East Arrival Cave submit to him. He was truly impressive. Qin Weiwei bit her red lips slightly. Now that the mystery was unraveled, she thought it might have been better left unsolved. After listening to that fellow's awe-inspiring deeds, it was as if he was the only one in the entire Mount Calming Sea who was capable, and it upset her very much. Yang Qing pondered with his eyes slightly closed for a moment before slowly turning around. He looked at Dan Biaoyi, who was kneeling, and said, "Rise!" "Thank you, Manor Head!" Dan Biaoyi stood up with a bitter expression, uncertain of his fate. Unexpectedly, Yang Qing did not chastise him. Instead, he said, "Don't let outsiders know what you said today. Act as if nothing has happened. No one will hold you accountable. If anything happens in East Arrival Cave in the future, I grant you permission to directly report to the Mountain Chieftain of Mount Calming Sea. Do you understand what I mean?" Dan Biaoyi was momentarily stunned but then showed a look of delight. He understood Yang Qing's intention. It meant that the matter would remain confidential, and he was being appointed as an informant within the East Arrival Cave. This meant that he had caught Yang Qing's attention. Unexpectedly, this mishap turned into an opportunity. "Yes, Head Manor. I will obey!" Dan Biaoyi cupped his fists in surprise. The sudden fright followed by this surprise was a stark contrast, almost making him feel disoriented. Chapter 82 Cave Master Is Wise "Here's your reward!" Yang Qing smiled and nodded. Qing Mei immediately took out a granule-sized pearl, emitting a soft halo, from her storage ring and presented it to Dan Biaoyi as a reward. "Thank you, Manor Head for your gracious reward!" Dan Biaoyi expressed his gratitude with repeated bows, his joy evident. "You may leave now," Yang Qing waved his hand. After Dan Biaoyi left the vicinity of the mountain, Yang Qing chuckled lightly and shook his head. "To secretly damage his own sect's gate right after taking office... Only this young man could come up with such an idea and dare to execute it. "Ah, so adept in both intellect and bravery. He's truly worth employing. If he were to become the leader of a sect, he could help me solve quite a few problems. However, his cultivation is a bit too low. Being a sect leader is already stretching it; taking on additional responsibilities would be excessive. Previously, I had him, a White Lotus First Grade surrendered soldier, stay in East Arrival Cave to see how influential my words are in South Edict Manor, to see if they hold any weight. It wasn't a rash decision; I wanted to see if anyone would dare to challenge it. Putting him in charge of East Arrival Cave was also a bit of a concern for me, whether it was right or wrong. But now, it seems that this young man possesses considerable ability. Perhaps I was overly cautious." Qing Mei and Qing Ju exchanged glances, both recognizing Yang Qing's growing admiration for Miao Yi. When the time was right, he would certainly promote Miao Yi. As handmaidens, they understood that they shouldn't keep too much distance from that Cave Master Miao in the future. On the other hand, Qin Weiwei twitched her lips, seemingly a little displeased. Little did she know that Yang Qing had already noticed her reaction and jokingly asked, "Weiwei, the Cave Master of East Arrival Cave I personally appointed didn't disappoint you, did he?" His tone was teasing. Of course, he knew that his daughter and Miao Yi weren't on good terms. However, it wasn't a comment Qin Weiwei appreciated. She stood up, walked to his side, and said, "He is having a good time now. I want to see if he can still be this carefree when he has to fulfill his promise to his subordinates with the Orbs of Will!" Yang Qing laughed out loud. He pointed at her and shook his head. "Oh, you! Do you really think so little of my chosen candidate for you? So what if he killed your mount? You really won't let it go, will you? "Have you considered that he's got all of them in his grasp, with evidence of their disloyalty to the sect? Even if he doesn't fulfill his promise later, do you think any of them would dare to challenge him?" Qin Weiwei was rendered at a loss for words, having struck with an epiphany. Yang Qing returned to his seat and sighed. "If I have a few more talents like that kid in South Edict Manor, the School of Blue Jade would not be a concern, and the matters of South Edict Manor would be much easier to handle." Qin Weiwei frowned and said, "Manor Head, after this incident, don't you think that guy is too scheming?" Yang Qing shook his head lightly and said, "If he was really scheming, he wouldn't have immediately confronted the situation head-on. Instead, he would have communicated first and arranged a way out for himself, so that he wouldn't bear the responsibility before making a move. His current approach shows that he thinks what he did is perfectly reasonable. That's why he went about casually inspecting things as if nothing had happened." Qin Weiwei was still dissatisfied and muttered, "No matter how I look at it, I feel that fellow is a little despicable and shameless. You admire him, so he seems pleasant to you no matter how you look at it." Yang Qing chuckled softly. "Whether you find him agreeable or not, whether I admire him or not, none of that matters. "In the battle at Transient Light Cave, he dared to face strong enemies with only White Lotus First Grade cultivation, refusing to retreat. When I sent him to cleanse the evil within Changfeng Region, Xiong Xiao's two White Lotus Third Grade cultivators died, yet he returned alive, successfully completing the mission. When I appointed him to oversee East Arrival Cave, despite the various Mountain Chieftains within Mount Calming Sea and even the entire South Edict Manor being reluctant to challenge the School of Blue Jade's influence, only he quickly pacified East Arrival Cave with swift measures. Other Cave Masters are just complaining and can't propose any feasible countermeasures. Is this not the reason I chose him for this responsibility? In short, Miao Yi has never disappointed me. Isn't this enough to prove his ability? Weiwei, as a leader, you sometimes can't just consider your own preferences. You need to learn to appreciate the strengths of your subordinates. There are no perfect people in this world. Knowing people and using them is what a superior should do!" Qin Weiwei remained silent. She knew that Yang Qing's reasoning was sound, but she couldn't deny her dislike for Miao Yi. In any case, she simply found the guy insufferable! A father knew his daughter the best. Yang Qing shook his head. He knew it would be difficult for him to change his daughter's mentality for a while. This kind of thing could not be forced. At the dock by the East Arrival City, looking out at the boundless blue sea and the vast sky, seagulls soared overhead. After spending a few days traveling around, Miao Yi quietly returned to the city to meet Ji Xiufang. Then he came to the very place where he had first landed when he crossed the sea. The dock was still bustling with activity. Various types of seafood were being unloaded from the fishing boats, and sailing ships that had come from distant places were docking as well. After asking around about the situation, Miao Yi and Zhu Tianbiao left the area on their horses. After a few days of patrolling, he had more or less figured out the situation in East Arrival City. As soon as the two of them left the pier, Miao Yi smiled and said, "That Xu Xinliang is a pretty good City Lord. Looks like we don't need to replace him." Zhu Tianbiao immediately flattered him, "Wise decision, Cave Master!" Miao Yi was speechless. He rolled his eyes. How could this have anything to do with me? It's on someone with good taste to have chosen this City Lord. It had nothing to do with me. You really don't know how to flatter. The two of them rode along the coastline. Miao Yi had lived on the island for ten years, so he had a good understanding of the sea. He could roughly determine the depth of the sea by its color. They arrived at an area with protruding coral reefs and both stopped. Miao Yi dismounted and flew up onto the coral reef to examine the surroundings. Zhu Tianbiao came to his side and asked, "What are you looking at, Cave Master?" Miao Yi asked in return, "I heard there's a type of sea-faring boat in the cultivation world that doesn't require manpower to travel long distances." "Yes." Zhu Tianbiao explained, "They are useless to cultivators who have reached the Red Lotus realm and can fly in the air. They are mainly used by cultivators below the Red Lotus realm." "Is it difficult to build?" "Not at all! In fact, they look quite similar to ordinary ships. The only difference is that they have spiral-shaped propellers built at the stern by craftsmen, connected to a transmission device that propels the ship forward. Those with conditions will use magic treasures to drive it. Those without conditions will use the strength of a dragon steed to run on the wheel at the end of the ship, which allows the boat to travel much faster than a regular manually-powered vessel. "Cave Master, why are you asking about this?" Miao Yi didn't answer his question but pointed to an area and said, "Right here. We'll dig out a small dock and build a ship for East Arrival Cave to use. Later, have Yan Xiu contact the laborers of East Arrival City to build it." Zhu Tianbiao cupped his fists and said, "Wise decision, Cave Master!" "Honestly..." Miao Yi had wanted to ask Zhu Tianbiao if there was anything wrong with his brain when he blatantly called him wise without even asking what he planned on doing. However, considering that he and Zhu Tianbiao had no common language, anything he said would be like talking to a brick wall. He decided not to waste his breath, leaving a mark on the coral reef with his silver spear before waving his hand. "We've been out for a few days, and we've seen enough. Let's go back!" Chapter 83 Bottomless Pit (1) It could be seen that Wang Zifa took good care of his fellow disciples, with four White Lotus Second Grade junior brothers and sisters taking turns guarding the mountain gate. Today, it was Nan SIsi's turn to guard the gate. Miao Yi and Zhu Tianbiao dismounted their horses under the gate archway. "Cave Master, you're finally back. Everyone has been anxiously awaiting your return." After receiving the reins the two men handed over, Nan Sisi turned around and immediately shouted, "The Cave Master has returned." Miao Yi glanced at Nan Sisi a couple of times and smiled as he entered the mountain gate. He did not think that everyone would miss him so much. It was likely that Nan Sisi was also flattering him. Before he even reached the main hall, the members of the cave came rushing over, greeting him one by one, "Welcome back, Cave Master." Miao Yi nodded and led the group into the great hall. After ascending to his seat, he asked, "Did anything happen while I was gone?" "There was!" A few people spoke in unison. The worries of Wang Zifa and the others were written all over their faces. "There was? Aren't you all fine? What happened?" Miao Yi looked at Yan Xiu, who was standing below, and asked. At the moment, he still trusted Yan Xiu the most. Yan Xiu, entirely composed, cupped his hands and said, "Cave Master, the day after you left, Mountain Chieftain Qin Weiwei rushed over with her men, demanding the truth behind Song Fu's death." Miao Yi turned grim at the mention of that woman. He wasn't worried that Song Fu's death would be exposed. Rather, she immediately rushed over for an investigation when he had just taken office. What was the meaning of this? To think that he had immediately sent someone to deliver a memorial to her. It was clear she didn't trust him. Miao Yi swept his gaze over everyone and coldly snorted without much courtesy. "Did that wretch intentionally come looking for trouble?" The once worried crowd was left speechless in an instant. Each one stared at him with wide eyes, mentally giving him a thumbs up. You're something, Cave Master. You actually dared to publicly scold the Manor Head's goddaughter, calling the Mountain Chieftain of Mount Calming Sea a wretch! "Ahem!" Miao Yi cleared his throat. He also realized that he had misspoken. How could he blurt out his thoughts in front of everyone? He switched to a smiling face and asked, "The Mountain Chieftain didn't say anything, did she?" Wang Zifa and the others secretly exchanged glances. It seemed like the relationship between this Cave Master and Manor Head Yang Qing wasn't as everyone had imagined. It seemed like he had a deep grudge. Even Yang Qing's daughter had been called a wretch. It showed the nature of their relationship. The School of Blue Jade had joined Yang Qing's side. They had mostly come with missions, so they couldn't truly listen to Yang Qing wholeheartedly. After being compromised by Miao Yi, they were concerned about how they would continue to deceive their sect. Now, it seemed that Cave Master Miao could secretly be won over to the School of Blue Jade. If they could turn Yang Qing's confidant into the School of Blue Jade's spy planted by Yang Qing's side, they could be justified to their sect. Perhaps it could even be considered a merit.                                                                                                                 Yan Xiu didn't think too much about it. He replied, "Mountain Chieftain didn't say anything. She just kept asking us about the truth." That's it?! Miao Yi thought it was a big deal. As long as he could keep the mouths of those from the School of Blue Jade shut, there was nothing Qin Weiwei could do even if she found out the truth! He was confident that Yang Qing, having just supported him to power, would remove him over this matter. Yang Qing would only be slapping himself in the face and admitting that he had a poor judge of character, wouldn't he? He believed Yang Qing wouldn't do anything to damage his own prestige as the Manor Head. Moreover, had he done anything wrong? The East Arrival Cave was his territory to begin with. So what if he reorganized it?! So be it that you, Yang Qing, sent me to East Arrival Cave without support, but you can't drag me down either, can you?! "You guys didn't spout nonsense, did you?" Miao Yi asked nonchalantly. Everyone immediately replied at the same time, "We are tight-lipped, but the Mountain Chieftain had taken Dan Biaoyi away. Who knows if he can withstand the pressure?" Miao Yi chuckled, "No need to worry about that. I believe Dan Biaoyi won't speak nonsense." What he didn't say out loud was that Dan Biaoyi had a hand in killing Song Fu. It'd be a wonder if he would easily give in. In fact, Yan Xiu and Qiu Shaoqun, who appeared to be relatively calm, also thought the same. The next second, faint sounds of galloping dragon steeds could be heard from outside. Everyone waited a while before they saw Dan Biaoyi, who was just mentioned, strode into the great hall. He cupped his hands toward the crowd in high spirits before bowing toward the center and greeted, "Cave Master!" Before Dan Biaoyi could speak, everyone surrounded him, asking him in a flurry whether he had disclosed any sensitive information after being taken away by the Mountain Chieftain. With Yang Qing's assurance as a foundation, Dan Biaoyi naturally pledged without reservation that he hadn't betrayed everyone. With these words, everyone immediately heaved a huge sigh of relief. One by one, they patted him on the shoulder, commending him for his loyalty. Miao Yi, who was sitting high on the throne, was also very happy to hear Dan Biaoyi's words. He crossed his legs, secretly pleased with himself. The entirety of East Arrival Cave is now under my control! "Don't get happy too soon. You all know Zheng Jinlong, don't you?" Dan Biaoyi asked, sweeping his gaze across the crowd. Wang Zifa nodded and said, "Of course. He is our senior brother. He entered the sect earlier than Senior Brother Song Fu." Everyone was curious as to why he mentioned Zheng Jinlong. Dan Biaoyi pointed outside and said, "He came with me. He is waiting outside for Cave Master's summon!" A sense of unease subtly permeated the air. Wang Zifa immediately asked, "Why did Senior Brother Zheng come here?" Dan Biaoyi sighed, "Although I managed to withstand the interrogation, the higher-ups gave our memorial to the School of Blue Jade for review. It seems that a senior from your school who was in the South Edict Manor personally spoke to the Manor Head. He said that Song Fu deserved to die for being disrespectful and asked that the Manor Head allow the School of Blue Jade to send another person to fill in Song Fu's vacancy to atone for his crimes. Thus, Zheng Jinlong came with me. "Everyone, let me be blunt, your school seems to be suspicious of this matter. Throughout the journey, Zheng Jinlong was subtly inquiring, so it's best if you all are prepared." With that, he cupped his fists toward Miao Yi and said, "I deliberately left Zheng Jinlong outside because I wanted to notify you beforehand and hope that you'd be prepared, Cave Master." Miao Yi, seated on high, nodded, then turned to the crowd, asking, "What do you all think of this matter?" After exchanging glances, the School of Blue Jade disciples, Wang Zifa in particular, said solemnly, "Cave Master, it's likely Senior Brother Zheng's visit is just as Dan Biaoyi said, to investigate Senior Brother Song's death." Miao Yi scoffed, "You School of Blue Jade really are persistent. They actually want to probe our situation. If he doesn't behave, all of you will attack together and kill him. There is no need for us to be afraid of him with our numbers. "By the way, what's his cultivation level?" Everyone's expressions changed drastically. Wang Zifa hurriedly waved his hand and said, "No, Cave Master! We'll be in big trouble if we also kill Senior Brother Zheng. Senior Brother Zheng is easy to kill, but if we kill Senior Brother Zheng, our sect might send another Blue Lotus cultivation disciple over. What would we do by then?" As the saying went, the spectators see most of the game. Yan Xiu, Qiu Shaoqun, and Dan Biaoyi glanced at each other, their expressions slightly twitching. They couldn't believe the Cave Master was discussing killing a member of the School of Blue Jade with their disciples, even acting as if it were a normal matter. What was the meaning of this?! The School of Blue Jade had really accepted a group of good disciples. Chapter 84 Bottomless Pit (2) Miao Yi said casually, "I can't do this or that. What do you suppose I do then?" Wang Zifa cupped his hands and said, "Cave Master, I have a way to pull Senior Brother Zheng to our side, but I need your help with one thing." Is this planning to pull his senior brother down with him? Miao Yi wondered, then said, "Let's hear it out." Wang Zifa replied, "Cave Master, Senior Brother Zheng also has a cultivation of White Lotus Third Grade. If... If Cave Master can give Senior Brother Zheng the same treatment as us in the distribution of Orbs of Will, I can find a way to persuade him." Many furrowed their brows and quickly observed Miao Yi's reaction, for it was a demanding request. Upon distribution, the remaining three orbs left for the Cave Master would leave him with nothing if given to Zheng Jinlong. Sure enough, Miao Yi turned grim, and he leaned slightly forward. "Wang Zifa, are you joking? If you take all the Orbs of Will away, wouldn't I have done for nothing? "Let me tell you something. You and your fellow companions will only obtain 14 of the 24 Orbs of Will we will collect at the end of the year. That's as many as I can give you. It's on you guys to distribute it among yourselves. "Appease your Senior Brother Zheng, if you can. If you can't, just kill him. I detest people who try to trick me." He wasn't afraid of any senior brothers. With so many people under his command, he could do whatever he wanted to even a White Lotus Third Grade cultivator who had come to his territory. Why would he need to compromise? "No, Cave Master. That's not what I mean." Wang Zifa hurriedly waved his hand. Miao Yi snorted coldly, "What do you mean, then?" Everyone looked at Wang Zifa, appearing to be eagerly waiting to listen. Wang Zifa cautiously asked, "Didn't you mention another source of Orbs of Will, Cave Master? What I mean is when the time comes, I can temporarily borrow three from a few of my junior brothers and sisters and give them to Senior Brother Zheng. Later, when we have more sources of Orbs of Will, you can reimburse them." Instantly, the expressions of Hou Sheng, Shang Youlai, and Wang Xiuqin changed drastically. Needless to say, redistributing the pearls wouldn't likely lead to Zhu Tianbiao, who possessed a White Lotus Third Grade cultivation level. Instead, it would likely fall upon those like them, who had a White Lotus Second Grade cultivation level. Most importantly, the supposed alternative source of the orbs mentioned by the Cave Master were only words. No one had actually seen it before. Naturally, it was best to secure whatever benefits they could first. Who could predict what would happen in the future?! However, since Wang Zifa had already spoken, they could only keep their unwillingness in their hearts, as it was not safe to voice it. Nan Sisi was outside guarding the mountain gate and did not know about the situation in the hall. Otherwise, she would likely also be discontented. "I see!" Miao Yi tapped his fingers on the armrest and pondered for a moment. He slowly nodded and said, "I can promise you that. However, when the time comes to earn other sources of Orbs of Will, you must not back down. You have to go with me!" A sudden unease struck Yan Xiu's heart, and a fleeting thought crossed his mind. Is the Cave Master really intending to hunt in the Sea of Constellations? Wang Zifa immediately nodded with a smile. "Of course. We all heed the Cave Master's command and follow you." He didn't swear the ultimate. Their support was conditional on the Cave Master's ability to venture to the places they were required to go. Miao Yi grinned at the other School of Blue Jade disciples and asked, "Do any of you have objections?" Wang Zifa immediately turned around and looked coldly at his junior brothers and sisters. Although Hou Sheng and the others were a little reluctant, they still squeezed out a smile and nodded. "Good!" Miao Yi slapped the armrest. "It's settled then. Zheng Jinlong will be left to you fellow disciples to deal with. "Dan Biaoyi, let him in!" Dan Biaoyi complied and soon returned with a plump man in blue robes. He wore a constant gentle smile and appeared younger than Song Fu. Wang Zifa and the others cupped their hands and greeted him as Senior Brother. The newcomer saluted all of them with a bow, then turned toward Miao Yi, who was seated high up, offering a respectful smile as he bowed. "I, Zheng Jinlong, have come to East Arrival Cave to serve and obey the Cave Master. I pay my respects to the Cave Master!" This person appeared to be more accommodating than Song Fu, at least making Miao Yi feel less averse. Thus, Miao Yi extended his hand slightly to help him up. "No need for formalities." After exchanging a few questions and answers, Zheng Jinlong maintained a respectful attitude and stayed within his subordinate role. After some pleasantries, as everyone dispersed from the council hall, Miao Yi suddenly spoke up, "Dan Biaoyi." Dan Biaoyi, who was at the doorway, turned around, returning to Miao Yi. "How may I be of assistance, Cave Master?" Miao Yi ambled down from his seat and stared at him with a forced smile. "Did you really not say anything? The wre— The Mountain Chieftain let you go just like that?" Dan Biaoyi's heart skipped a beat. When he thought about how he didn't reveal any flaws, he exclaimed in shock, "I have a part in killing Song Fu. Speaking of it will do me no good. Are you suspecting me, Cave Master?" "No. Just wondering." Miao Yi laughed heartily as he patted Dan Biaoyi's shoulder. Then, he turned to beckon Yan Xiu over as he headed toward the rear hall. In the backyard, Charcoal, who had eaten and drank his fill, lay lazily on by the door, swinging his tail as he dozed off. When Miao Yi entered the courtyard, he merely took a peek. All was safe; it wasn't the woman who had stabbed him in the butt. So it continued to doze. Following Miao Yi, Yan Xiu tentatively asked, "Cave Master, are you suspecting that Dan Biaoyi told the truth?" "No, I just feel that Qin Weiwei, that wretched woman, wouldn't be this easy to deal with. After all, she has always been waiting to find faults with me." Miao Yi waved his hand dismissively. "It doesn't matter either if he reveals it." Hearing that the Cave Master had returned, Qian'er and Xue'er, who were waiting in the courtyard, slightly lowered their heads and followed behind the two. Once Miao Yi entered the room and sat down, the two handmaidens immediately served him fragrant tea and silently stood on either side. Miao Yi glanced at them briefly, then waved his hand to signal them to leave. He didn't have any trust in them at present. After the two left, Miao Yi turned to Yan Xiu. "I've marked a spot by the sea. Contact East Arrival City later and organize some laborers..." As he explained the construction of the pier and ships, Yan Xiu suddenly exclaimed in surprise, "Cave Master, you're not really planning on hunting in the Sea of Constellations, are you?" "You're overthinking. It's for my cultivation." "Cultivation?" "Make sure the laborers are paid properly. I'll leave this matter in your hands. That's it for now. I'm going to wash up." With that, Miao Yi left. Yan Xiu could only bow in acknowledgment. Upon leaving the chamber and encountering Qian'er and Xue'er outside, he casually said, "The Cave Master wants to bathe." As he passed them by, he stopped and reminded them, "Not everybody has the chance to become the Cave Master's handmaiden in the entire East Arrival City. A handmaiden who can't earn the Cave Master's trust won't stay here for long..." Chapter 85 Bottomless Pit (3) In the tranquil chamber, Miao Yi had just stripped off his clothes and immersed himself in the comfortably warm pool, and closed his eyes to enjoy for a moment when a series of footsteps came from outside. At that, he opened his eyes and looked toward the entrance of the stone chamber. Who goes there?! It was none other than Qian'er and Xue'er, who were feeling a little uneasy. They had already gotten out of their outer garments, wearing only a bra and a pair of shorts. Their crystal-clear and tender shoulders, delicate and fair collarbones, as well as their slender limbs, and elegantly curved waistlines, all were exposed to the air. Like bashful blossoms, the two young girls, dressed in barely any clothing, walked in holding bathing supplies, their faces blushing. Miao Y's mouth fell open, and he was momentarily rendered speechless. Suddenly, a thought hit him, and his face turned red. He quickly reached for a piece of clothing on the shore and pressed it into the water, covering his crotch. He asked nervously, "What are you two doing here?" "To attend to your bath, Cave Master," the two of them said simultaneously, their faces red. Miao Yi hastily shook his head, clutching his lower body. "No need. I can manage my own." "This is what we ought to do." The two handmaidens heeded Yan Xiu's earlier words and, steeling themselves, set down their things. They dipped their fair legs into the water and didn't care whether Miao Yi agreed or not, One gently spread his hair while the other used a scoop to pour water over his shoulders. Miao Yi was beyond embarrassed and even felt a surge of annoyance. However, there were certain things that were part of a man's nature. As the two young girls entered the water, their delicate and semi-transparent short gauzy outfits couldn't withstand the charm of the spring water. Drenched by the water, they became faintly visible, and their maidenly fragrance caused Miao Yi's heart to race instantly. He didn't dare look any longer. The thought of telling them to leave was on the tip of his tongue, but he swallowed back down. However, he dared not continue staring at their nearly naked bodies. He closed his eyes, clenching his hands tightly over his crotch, allowing the gentle touches of the two to graze his body. The sensation of their fingertips brushing against his skin made him involuntarily shiver. He began to adapt over time, and after he did, he felt an indescribable comfort. That said, his hands never left his crotch. It should be noted that before East Arrival City selected these young girls to be offered to the Immortals, they were specially trained by experts. Naturally, it was done to please the Immortals, so their skills in serving people had been honed through rigorous practice. The East Arrival City wouldn't dare present anything subpar... The cultivation cave residence in the area would never be too shabby. Dreamy green mountains, with pathways weaving through the mountain range, were filled with birds and beasts. A group of people wandered through the peculiar peaks, admired the vast forests, and listened to the tinkling of spring water. Wang Zifa and his fellow junior brothers and sisters were showing Senior Brother Zheng around, acquainting him with its beauty and splendor, and treating him with the utmost respect. "The Six Sages control different parts of the world, and the various caves and mansions under their jurisdiction occupy places of natural beauty and strategic importance. It is a good place!" The group entered a mountain pavilion, and as they listened to the younger disciples' introductions, Zheng Jinlong admired the surrounding scenic beauty, genuinely remarking that even the mere scenery of East Arrival Cave was comparable to the grand School of Blue Jade. His face always bore a gentle smile, and none could discern his thoughts from his expressions. By his side, Wang Zifa commented with a grin, "Now that the School of Blue Jade has also joined this circle, there are great prospects ahead!" Zheng Jinlong responded with a simple "Oh?" before probing, "Do you still hold the sect in your hearts?" His words froze the smiles on everyone's faces. The atmosphere grew tense, and they all felt that an inevitable confrontation had begun. "Your words disturb us, Senior Brother—" Wang Zifa began, but was abruptly cut off by Zheng Jinlong, who still wore his mild smile, yet now with a hint of icy undertones. "Disturbed? Do you think you're not audacious enough? All eyes turned to Wang Zifa, who had claimed to have a plan. With a look of surprise, Wang Zifa queried, "What do you mean, Senior Brother?" Still smiling, Zheng Jinlong countered, "Junior Brother, are you playing dumb with me? Aren't you going to give the sect an explanation for Junior Brother Song's death?" Wang Zifa turned grave. "Senior Brother Song had almost ruined a significant opportunity for the School of Blue Jade. He deserved to die! Given another chance, we would do it all over again!" Zheng Jinlong was stunned. After pondering for a while, he slowly stated, "Is there more to the story? I would like to hear the details." Wang Zifa said in a low voice, "Senior Brother, some things are understood even if they aren't spoken out loud. The School of Blue Jade cannot always remain under someone's shadow. Sooner or later, we need to replace Yang Qing. Don't you agree, Senior Brother?" Zheng Jinlong didn't commit to an answer, neither confirming nor denying. Instead, he asked, "What does this have to do with Junior Brother Song's death?" "Of course, there's a connection." Wang Zifa replied, "What is your opinion on Miao Yi?" Zheng Jinlong couldn't quite figure out what Wang Zifa was trying to say. He pondered for a while and said, "I'm not clear about other aspects, but I do know that Miao Yi has a low cultivation level and isn't impressive. Without Yang Qing's favor, he wouldn't have reached his current status. If I put it this way, does it satisfy you, Junior Brother?" "Your insight is profound, Senior Brother!" Wang Zifa cupped his fists. "It is exactly as you say. However, Senior Brother, I only know one part of the story. The relationship between Miao Yi and Yang Qing isn't as close as it appears to outsiders. We once heard him slip up and call Qin Weiwei a 'wretch'!" Zheng Jinlong naturally knew Qin Weiwei was Yang Qing's goddaughter. He was surprised that Miao Yi had dared to insult the Manor Head's daughter with such language. The revelation piqued his curiosity. "Is that so? But what does this have to do with Junior Brother Song's death?" Wang Zifa immediately whispered into his ear, altering the facts with some embellishments. Zheng Jinlong was shocked. "Three orbs? How could he have so many Orbs of Will to distribute among us?" "We personally witnessed him holding an Orb of Will that accumulated the wishes of ten thousand people for a year..." Wang Zifa muttered. "He has another source for Orbs of Will?" Zheng Jinlong's eyes lit up. Wang Zifa sighed. "I'm sure you understand our predicament now, Senior Brother. To put it bluntly, although your standing in the sect is higher than ours, once this news reaches the sect, the humble East Arrival Cave will become highly sought after. The senior cultivators will surely send their trusted confidants to replace us. "Our failure is a minor concern, but if this information is exposed, once Yang Qing calls Miao Yi back, all our efforts to trace the source of Orbs of Will for the sect will be wasted. This will be a loss of the sect, so Song Fu must die!" Zheng Jinlong wasn't convinced that these fellows were primarily concerned about tracing the source of the Orbs of Will for the sect. He suspected their true motive was to secure their own paths. At the very least, by taking Miao Yi away from the East Arrival Cave, they would ensure that they couldn't get the three Orbs of Will that year. If someone else became the Cave Master, they certainly wouldn't be as generous. Speaking of which, with so many benefits at stake, Zheng Jinlong found himself intrigued as well. It seemed his junior disciples wanted him to have a share in this opportunity, all working together towards a common goal! However, this matter had already aroused the suspicion of the sect. Otherwise, they would not have sent him. Zheng Jinlong frowned. "Junior Brother, I understand your intentions for the sect, but you should know that without providing the sect a reasonable explanation, we won't pass scrutiny. Teach me how." Chapter 86 Bottomless Pit (4) Wang Zifa was secretly pleased, knowing that Zheng Jinlong was also tempted. However, he feigned surprise and said, "Senior Brother, do you not understand what I mean?" Zheng Jinlong hesitated briefly, pondering, but still couldn't grasp it. He asked, "Junior Brother, please explain in detail." In a hushed voice, Wang Zifa explained, "As Senior Brother mentioned, Miao Yi is Yang Qing's confidant. However, the reality differs from appearances. Miao Yi's insult to Qin Weiwei as a 'wretch' indicates that he's discontented with Yang Qing. You should know that he was originally unwilling to surrender and only did so under duress by Yang Qing. "Our School of Blue Jade is well-positioned. If we could transform Yang Qing's confidant into a hidden pawn placed by us beside him... "Explaining this to the higher-ups might alleviate the sect's suspicions." "Silence followed Zheng Jinlong's thoughts. If he actually went through with this, he would be stuck in the same boat as them. Once something happened, neither he nor they would be able to escape. After returning to his cultivation courtyard, Zheng Jinlong wrestled with hesitation and conflict. On one side was the terrifying consequence of angering the sect, while on the other was the great temptation of benefits. Ultimately, he couldn't discard the potential gains. After observing and contemplating for a few days, and with continuous encouragement from Wang Zifa and the others, Zheng Jinlong, with a firm resolve, wrote a confidential report. The report fabricated a series of arrogant and domineering deeds by Song Fu, claiming that he had disregarded the overall situation. Indeed, he deserved to die. However, after Miao Yi killed Song Fu, Wang Zifa and the others were also furious and nearly engaged in a fight with Miao Yi. Fortunately, they coincidentally learned that Miao Yi only outwardly showed submission to Yang Qing, but actually harbored significant dissatisfaction. He even secretly insulted Yang Qing's goddaughter. Wang Zifa and the others also had the bigger picture in mind, believing that it wasn't yet the time for a falling out between the School of Blue Jade and Yang Qing. Since Song Fu was already dead and couldn't be redeemed, they decided to hold back on this matter. They aimed to keep Miao Yi, foster his gratitude, and develop him into a hidden pawn beside Yang Qing, awaiting a more opportune time for the School of Blue Jade. Besides, Miao Yi's cultivation was low, making him easier to control. Gaining control over Miao Yi meant gaining control over East Arrival Cave. If Miao Yi was removed from East Arrival Cave because of this matter and Yang Qing replaced him with someone of higher cultivation, it would be inconvenient for the School of Blue Jade to maintain control over East Arrival Cave. In conclusion, Zheng Jinlong said at the end. expressed that he believed Wang Zifa and the others had genuinely good intentions. He requested the sect to carefully consider this matter. In the courtyard, as he placed the confidential report into the foot tube of a goshawk, Zheng Jinlong still harbored some hesitation, lingering in indecision. Eventually, with a determined resolve, he gritted his teeth and released the goshawk into the air. The goshawk messenger quickly spread its wings and flew off into the distance... There was an old saying, "Heroes have a weakness for beauty." Perhaps the phrase was a little exaggerated, but after bathing with the two handmaidens, Miao Yi's indifferent attitude toward them changed. He no longer treated them as servants. While Miao Yi had maintained a line of propriety and did not overstep boundaries, having experienced such intimate contact with women for the first time altered his perception of them. He unconsciously began to see them as 'his' people and became more casual in his orders to them. Qian'er and Xue'er, after serving their master, no longer felt as nervous. In fact, they even found their first bath with the Cave Master amusing upon recollection. The dignified Cave Master was actually even more shy and nervous than they were! It turned out that even Immortals could be bashful! As Yan Xiu entered the backyard of the East Arrival Hall and saw the scene in the pavilion, he smiled. Xue'er was playing the zither,  producing enchanting melodies, while Qian'er gracefully danced to the music. Miao Yi, on the other hand, watched them with enjoyment with a teacup in his hand. He seemed to be living a leisurely life. Seeing Yan Xiu approach, Miao Yi signaled for Qian'er and Xue'er to halt. As Yan Xiu stepped into the pavilion, he glanced at the two girls and asked with a smile, "Are you satisfied with these two, Cave Master? If not, I can ask the City Lord of East Arrival City to replace them." It was still because of the believers. Not everyone received such treatment. Once chosen, there was typically no switching allowed. If every cultivator treated every woman in the world as their own, there would be chaos. However, the Cave Master did have some privileges. Only the people in the system under the command of the Sixth Saint could enjoy such treatment. Independent cultivators aren't afforded such luxuries. Other cultivators could visit brothels without issue, but if they dared to interfere with the balance of the believers' reproduction or disrupt the harmony, the cultivators inside the system would immediately mobilize their troops to hunt them down. They were determined to uphold their privileges! Indeed, one of the reasons everyone aspired to join the structure was for the various privileges which independent cultivators simply cannot match. Yan Xiu's words made Qian'er and Xue'er immediately look anxiously at Miao Yi. Before becoming Immortal's handmaidens, a considerable amount of effort had been put into training these girls in East Arrival City. They were pampered with delicious food and drinks, and no one dared to offend them, for they were to become Immortal's handmaidens. Offending them could potentially invite retaliation in the future. However, if they were sent back, they would fall from the heavens to the ground directly. Without the background of being Immortal's handmaiden, no one would pay them any attention in the future. Moreover, the consequences of being returned were self-evident. It would certainly indicate failure in serving the Immortal, inevitably infuriating those who had invested considerable effort. Miao Yi couldn't stand the two girls' enigmatic gazes fixed on him, and being reminded of the intimate bath incident, he cleared his throat and said, "They're fine. No need for a replacement." He didn't want rumors about his awkwardness during the bath to spread either. These words signified that the two girls had passed their probationary period and were officially recognized. Their status changed instantaneously. Even Yan Xiu immediately greeted the two with a bow, saying, "Elder Miss, Younger Miss!" The two girls immediately beamed with joy as even an Immortal began addressing them with respect. They understood that the Cave Master had officially acknowledged the two of them. From then on, their status would rise above many others, at least surpassing the status of those maidens selected to serve the other Immortals because they were the Cave Master's handmaidens. Before they came, they had no idea that they were going to serve the Cave Master himself. This kind of luck wasn't something just anyone had; at least two out of a hundred thousand could experience it. The two girls were both excited and obedient. Their gazes toward Miao Yi had changed. They sidled up, standing one on either side of him. Miao Yi did not avoid them anymore either. He knew he had to start exposing them to certain matters once he had chosen them. They were meant to serve him, just as Qing Mei and Qing Ju had served Yang Qing. If they didn't understand anything, they wouldn't be of much use. "Is there any response from Zheng Jinlong?" Miao Yi asked. Yan Xiu replied, "There hasn't been any response so far. Zheng Jinlong has been holed up in his own cultivation residence and has not come out. Wang Zifa and the others are getting anxious and keep urging him." Chapter 87 Bottomless Pit (5) Just as the two were discussing, Zheng Jinlong, who was anxiously waiting for news in the courtyard, stopped in his tracks. He looked at the black dot in the sky and stretched out his arm to welcome it. The goshawk messenger he had sent flying two days ago finally returned and landed on his arm. He impatiently took out a narrow jade archive from the goshawk's feet and injected magic power into it to check. It read, "Wang Zifa and the others are well-intentioned. Cooperate!" This was the reply from the School of Blue Jade. Zheng Jinlong immediately heaved a heavy sigh of relief. He didn't know their true stance, so he didn't want to expose his position to Wang Zifa and the others. If he revealed too much, he would be implicated. If the School of Blue Jade wanted to investigate thoroughly, he wouldn't be able to stop them. Having successfully fooled the sect, Zheng Jinlong felt more confident. He quickly placed the goshawk into its nest, then returned to his room. He changed out of his blue attire into a black one. The Cave Master of East Arrival Cave found the clothes of the School of Blue Jade to be an eyesore and insisted on unifying the clothes of East Arrival Cave. When Zheng Jinlong, who was dressed entirely in black, walked out of the courtyard, Wang Zifa and the others appeared out of nowhere and started repeating, "Senior Brother, have you considered it?" They were also anxious. If Zheng Jinlong didn't cooperate, they would have to follow Miao Yi's plan and eliminate him together. Although they understood the approach was a desperate move, they had no other choice. They could only tackle one problem at a time. "Considering how devoted you all are to the sect, I have racked my brains for you this time!" Zheng Jinlong sighed and handed them the jade archive with the secret message he had just received. After taking turns infusing their magic power and reading the message, they were all overjoyed. Under Wang Zifa's signal, the few of them stood in a row and cupped their hands together. "Thank you, Senior Brother!" "I haven't seen Cave Master for a few days. I wonder if he has any orders for me!" After Zheng Jinlong said this, everyone knew he had already decided to get a share. This was to make Cave Master feel at ease. Everyone immediately expressed their willingness to accompany him. Having received the notice, Miao Yi led Qian'er and Xue'er from the rear hall to the front hall. Miao Yi took his seat on the high platform while Qian'er and Xue'er stood nervously on either side of his throne. Yan Xiu, who had come along, stood at his spot below. "Summon them in!" Miao Yi said plainly. Yan Xiu had already explained the rules to the two girls earlier. Xue'er, the Younger Miss, jolted and immediately strode to the entrance of the great hall. She mustered all her courage and shouted to the people waiting below the high steps, "The Cave Master invites everyone into the great hall for a discussion!" Though her voice was not particularly loud, the trembling revealed her nervousness. Facing a group of immortals like this and dealing with such an imposing atmosphere for the first time could certainly be overwhelming. Once Zheng Jinlong and the others entered the great hall, Miao Yi noticed he was also dressed in black, which indicated his stance. A hint of a smile flashed across his eyes, knowing that Zheng Jinlong had also been dragged into the plan. He looked at Wang Zifa, who nodded in understanding and immediately transmitted a message through telepathy, "Mission accomplished!" "All hail, Cave Master!" Everyone cupped their hands in unison. Now that everyone was finally here, there was no need to worry about lacking people in the future. They wouldn't fear fights anymore, and even if they encountered a White Lotus Fourth Grade cultivator, they could still hold their own. Miao Yi smiled and said, "No need for excessive courtesy!" Qian'er and Xue'er glanced at Miao Yi subconsciously. They noticed the Cave Lord's grandeur—so many immortals listen to him alone. In truth, there were only nine individuals there. Including the one guarding the mountain gate outside, there were a total of ten subordinates. The East Arrival Cave could not afford to support too many people. However, for the two girls who had just arrived, even one Immortal was already a revered existence in their eyes, let alone ten. They had never encountered such a situation before, where so many immortals they once looked up to were now standing before them. If they knew that their Master's cultivation was the lowest among all the Immortals, who knew how they would react? After the group arranged themselves in two rows, Zheng Jinlong stepped forward and saluted again, "I, Zheng Jinlong, have just arrived and have yet to contribute to East Arrival Cave. I wonder if there is anything I can do?" This was his way of showing his willingness to follow orders. Miao Yi gave a faint smile and said, "Newcomers always need to prove themselves. How about you guard the mountain gate for a day?" The person below was stunned. He sent another White Lotus Third Grade cultivator to guard the gate again?! Did the Cave Master not understand Zheng Jinlong's allegiance and wanted to kill him? Zheng Jinlong was also startled. His polite words were meant to be a surface-level gesture, not to be taken literally. He hadn't expected Miao Yi to actually act on it. It occurred to him that this guy might have lower cultivation, but he had the ability to kill a White Lotus Third Grade cultivator. However, he quickly realized the Cave Master's intentions. He wanted to see if he was truly willing to accept orders. The Cave Master didn't trust words alone; he wanted Zheng Jinlong to demonstrate his commitment through actions. "As you wish, Cave Master!" Zheng Jinlong cupped his fists and accepted the order. It was good that he agreed. Miao Yi couldn't be bothered to beat around the bush with him. To him, this was his own territory. It was a very simple matter. "While everyone is almost here, let me introduce you all..." Miao Yi raised his hand and pointed at the handmaidens on his left and right. "This is Qian'er, and this is Xue'er!" After exchanging glances, they cupped their fists and said, "Greetings, Elder Miss, greetings, Younger Miss!" Qian'er and Xue'er nervously and hesitantly bowed in return. After the exchange and everyone dispersed, Zheng Jinlong went to the mountain for his shift, causing the person currently on duty, Wang Xiuqin, to be anxious. She didn't dare to trouble her senior brother by making him guard the gate. Once she heard that it was the Cave Master's idea, she finally let go. However, she reminded him in a low voice, "Senior Brother, you know about Senior Brother Song's situation. Be cautious." Zheng Jinlong nodded. , seemingly nonchalant on the surface, but deep down, he was also on high alert. He was still a little worried that the Cave Master would play dirty. Everyone wasn't oblivious to Song Fu's incident with the damaged plaque. Later, they all guessed that Miao Yi had played dirty and merely found an excuse to lash out in anger. Therefore, Zheng Jinlong decided that he would firmly  guard the mountain gate that day, lest he met with an unexpected failure. News of Zheng Jinlong's obedience quickly reached Mount Calming Sea. Qin Weiwei, dressed in snow-white clothes, lay on a chair in the loft. She read the confidential report in her hand with a hint of annoyance. That fellow had actually managed to deal with the guy the School of Blue Jade sent to investigate. Were all the School of Blue Jade disciples trash? Yang Qing knew that he couldn't keep Song Fu's death a secret, and there was no point in doing so either. Therefore, he immediately summoned the responsible personnel from the School of Blue Jade and showed them the pile of memorials. The person from the School of Blue Jade didn't hesitate to condemn Song Fu for his death at all. That said, they also requested Yang Qing to arrange for another person to atone for his crimes. Everyone knew that it was just a pretense. The real intention was to investigate the truth behind the matter. Still, Yang Qing agreed on the spot. Later, Qin Weiwei asked Yang Qing why he agreed. What if they found out the truth? Yang Qing replied, "If it's uncovered, it's uncovered. I'll make my stance clear. I want to see how the School of Blue Jade reacts. I want to see where they draw the line. Secondly, I want to send some trouble to that kid and see if he can handle it. Let's hope he won't disappoint me!" The confidential report quickly made it's way to South Edict Manor. Inside the same mountain pavilion, Yang Qing, who had received the report, chuckled softly, "One more down the drain. This kid really turned East Arrival Cave into a bottomless pit, swallowing one after another! Looks like the School of Blue Jade isn't anything special either. They can't even handle a mere Cave Master under me. Haha!" Qing Mei and Qing Ju exchanged glances. That young man had made the Manor Head proud once again. It was evident that the Manor Head grew even more appreciative of him. Most importantly, the fellow dealt with the School of Blue Jade exactly as the Manor Head had wanted. Chapter 88 Hatching Dark Eggs (1) After Zheng Jinlong was dealt with, the School of Blue Jade had also been handled. With no more immediate worries, Miao Yi could finally concentrate on his cultivation. However, before that, he still had one more thing to do. Having just taken over East Arrival Cave, he had to reorganize it, so he hadn't had time until now to experiment with the hell mantis eggs he had gotten from the Boundless Secular World with Lao Bai. On a day when dawn had barely arrived, Miao Yi instructed Qian'er and Xue'er to guard outside and not let anyone disturb him. Then, he went into the quiet chamber alone to prepare. Unfortunately, Lao Bai had emphasized that this secret technique should not be passed on to others. As soon as he took out the large piece of insect eggs, the temperature in the room seemed to have dropped a little. Holding the insect eggs in his hand was like holding an ice cube. Miao Yi clicked his tongue. "As expected of a freak!" Carefully, he peeled each egg from the mucous membrane, then arranged a hundred blackish eggs, each the size of a quail egg, onto a jade plate. After that, he took out a small knife, holding the blade in his left palm and grasping the haft with his right. With a pull, blood flowed from his left palm. With his bloodied palm, he quickly flipped and caressed each egg. Old Bai had instructed him to coat each egg with his own blood without leaving any gaps. This would separate yin and yang with his vital essence and also allow the dark embryo to feel his presence fully from the beginning of their incubation. After some effort, he turned each egg into a dark red color. Once he was confident that there were no mistakes, he loosened his tied-up hair and yanked a bunch of hair from his head. This was also part of Lao Bai's instructed technique. The hair needed to be intact with the root and without any breaks. He had mentioned that since he was going to incubate the dark eggs, the connection could not be severed. In a single pull, he collected over a hundred strands of hair. After careful selection, about a dozen hair strands without roots were deemed useless. He repeatedly pulled from his head several times until he had a hundred strands of undamaged hair, complete with their roots. He dipped the roots of the hundred strands of hair into the fresh blood in his left palm. Then, he gripped all the hair strands together in his palm. With a spell, the hundred strands of hair immediately turned stiff and rigid, resembling porcupine quills. Holding the bundle of hair over the jade plate, he directed the spell toward each egg in the plate and thrust down. The outer surface of the eggs was not hard, but remarkably tough and smooth. It took some effort to puncture the eggs' surfaces with the roots of the blood-coated hair. This process, according to Lao Bai's words, was called "The Thread Connecting the Yin and Yang of Two Realms." The Yin represented the dark eggs, and the Yang was Miao Yi himself. His hair served as the thread connecting the two realms, allowing the hatched hell mantises to be in tune with his intentions and be submissive to his control. The reason Miao Yi pulled his hair and caused self-inflicted bleeding was that he hoped to be able to control these formidable creatures one day. Although he didn't know how powerful the hell mantis was, even after he became a cultivator, he still felt completely powerless when facing them. Almost the instant the hundred strands of hair were inserted into the dark egg, a bone-piercing chill rapidly flowed through the strands of hair. It wasn't pure coldness, but a sensation that seemed to create an illusion in an instant. It was as if he was instantly submerged in the netherworld, a feeling that made the soul tremble in fear. The eerie sensation caused Miao Yi to enter a trance-like state almost immediately. Gradually, his soul seemed to float aimlessly within the endless abyss of the netherworld, drifting about. For an ordinary person, such a condition would result in soul detachment, leading to severe consequences. Fortunately, his cultivation of the 'Star Fire Art' came into play at a critical moment, and when the chilling power encroached on his body, it automatically rebounded, circulating in a self-sustaining cycle. A surge of warmth spread rapidly throughout his body, instantly expelling the chilling force with unstoppable force, an overpowering dominance. Miao Yi shuddered intensely, snapping out of his daze. He immediately discovered that a layer of frost had formed on the surface of the hundred strands of hair. "Wow, these dark eggs are really bizarre. They actually managed to breach my mental defenses!" Miao Yi clicked his tongue in amazement. Now, he was even more eager to see what would hatch from these eggs. Calming his mind, Miao Yi carefully recollected the method Lao Bai had imparted to him. Gripping the hundred strands of hair with his five fingers, he began to silently channel his transcendence energy into the hundred dark eggs along the hundred strands of hair, using a secret technique as a medium. In less than half an hour, Miao Yi opened his eyes and withdrew his transcendence energy. He also let go of the hand that held the hundred strands of hair. Under the influence of his technique, the frost that had previously melted on the hundred strands of hair quickly spread from the roots, enveloping them once more in a layer of frost. He wasn't sure if this would work, but he followed Lao Bai's instructions anyway. He flipped his palm over and summoned the Glorious Star immortal herb from his storage ring, then puckered his lips and blew out a small nebula from the immortal herb to the wound on his left palm. The bloody wound immediately healed at a visible rate. Once it was completely restored, Miao Yi looked at the immortal herb in his hand and couldn't help but shake his head and sigh. He was really lucky. That time, the hell mantis had a Glorious Star immortal herb hanging from its body. If not for this immortal herb, it would probably be a little troublesome to hatch the dark egg. The reason was simple. According to Lao Bai's secret method, the dark egg had to be covered in his fresh blood every day for eighty-one days, without interruption. Otherwise, all of his previous efforts would have been wasted. In other words, he needed to apply blood and cut himself eighty-one times in succession. If he hadn't been fortunate enough to acquire the immortal herb, even cultivators would find it difficult to endure the daily cutting and bloodletting, let alone mortals. After washing off the blood on his hands in the flowing hot spring pool, Miao Yi turned around and carried the jade plate out of the quiet room. Qian'er and Xue'er, who were guarding outside, couldn't help but be curious. What were those black and red, and white hairy things on the plate? Regardless of what it was, Xue'er voluntarily reached out to help Miao Yi take it. Probably having used to ordering them around now, Miao Yi handed it over to her without much thought. He was about to give some instructions when he noticed Xue'er's face instantly turning pale. She held the jade plate, trembling violently, causing the plate to slip from her grasp. Fortunately, Miao Yi's quick reflexes allowed him to catch the plate and grab Xue'er's arm as she tilted over. He realized his oversight.  The contents of the jade plate emitted extremely heavy Yin Qi. He himself had almost been affected by it. Ordinary people would not have been able to withstand it. However, his cultivation technique was highly effective against Yin Qi. He quickly cast a spell to transfer his energy into Xue'er's body, instantly dispelling the invading Yin Qi from within her. Xue'er, whose eyes had rolled back, slowly recovered. However, her vitality had been momentarily drained by the Yin Qi. She looked a bit feeble standing there, her face still pale. Chapter 89 Hatching Dark Eggs (2) "Sorry, I forgot that you are still mortals and cannot touch this thing." Miao Yi asked, "Xue'er, are you alright?" Qian'er and Xue'er looked at the jade plate with reverence. So it was something that mortals could not touch. Xue'er shook her head and quickly apologized, "I'm very sorry for almost breaking your thing, Cave Master." "It's fine." Miao Yi chuckled and said, "I need you two to do something for me. Come with me!" With that, the two followed him out of the hall. They were greeted by the bright sunlight outside. As soon as the sunlight touched the contents of the jade plate, the frost-covered hairs emitted thin black smoke, the frost vanished, and the hairs instantly regained their natural appearance. Regular frost wouldn't disappear or emit black smoke when exposed to sunlight. Obviously, the frost covering the hairs wasn't the natural kind, but rather a manifestation of extreme Yin Qi. The sudden transformation of the frost into hair and the subsequent emission of black smoke shocked Qian'er and Xue'er once again.  Instead of sensing Immortal Qi, they felt a wave of Evil Qi. Charcoal, lying on his side, dozing off with its tail wagging, also suddenly sneezed. It suddenly raised its head and widened its eyes, looking at the thing in Miao Yi's hand. It seemed to have sensed something. But when he saw Miao Yi leading the two handmaidens up to the Star Observation Platform, and it didn't affect it in any way, it returned to its slumber. It was the perfect epitome of laziness. The Star Observation Platform was actually a high platform designed for stargazing. On the Star Observation Platform, Miao Yi placed the jade plate on the ground. According to Lao Bai, once the process began, the object should not come into contact with the ground until hatching. It needed to be kept separated from the ground and placing it on the Star Observation Platform was just perfect. Under the scorching sun, Miao Yi squatted down and observed for a while. The gentle breeze rustled the hairs inserted into the dark eggs. He wasn't sure if Lao Bai's claim that the dark embryos would gradually become familiar with and adapt to the mortal world through these hairs was true or not. "Qian'er, Xue'er!" Miao Yi stood up. "Yes!" The two girls replied in unison. Miao Yi pointed at the contents of the jade plate and said, "Starting today, I'll be entering seclusion for cultivation. The two of you will take turns guarding the bottom of the Star Observation Platform. Do not let anyone come near this object, and you must not touch it. It should also not come into contact with the ground below the platform. "Before the sun sets each day, or when it's cloudy or raining, and the sun isn't visible, remember to come to the silent chamber and notify me. Also, notify me before sunrise every day." "We will remember, Cave Master!" The two girls nodded in acknowledgment. The three of them descended the Star Observation Platform and reached the pavilion. After inviting the two girls to sit down, Miao Yi asked, "Do the two of you know how to do needlework?" The two of them nodded again. "We do." "Make a close-fitting vest for me..." Miao Yi began to gesture and describe the style of the vest he wanted them to sew. After understanding his instructions, the two handmaidens quickly fetched needles, threads, and fabric. After they returned, Qian'er began cutting the fabric while Xue'er helped Miao Yi tidy up his disheveled hair. Just then, Yan Xiu entered the courtyard and found Miao Yi. He conveyed that he had already coordinated with East Arrival City, and the construction of the docks and ships would soon begin. "Make sure the laborers are paid properly," Miao Yi reminded. This was not the first time he had mentioned it, and Yan Xiu naturally assured him that it would be taken care of. Noticing the pallor on Xue'er's face, he couldn't help but ask, "Is Younger Miss feeling unwell? She looks a little pale." Xue'er hurriedly shook her head, still feeling a lingering fear from earlier. Miao Yi turned to look at Xue'er's still pale complexion. He knew that it was because she had been slightly weakened due to the incident. It wasn't serious. At that, he said to Yan Xiu, "Speaking of them, I was just about to look for you." Yan Xiu asked, "What orders do you have, Cave Master?" "Don't the two of them have cultivation aptitude?" Yan Xiu immediately guessed what Miao Yi was going to say, "Do you plan to have them cultivate, Cave Master?" Qian'er and Xue'er immediately sneaked a glance at Miao Yi. They had been here for a few days and had heard people discussing cultivation, so they had a vague understanding of what it was. Their hearts couldn't help but race a bit, and their ears perked up. "Exactly!" Miao Yi nodded. This was indeed his plan. He thought having two weak girls serving him wouldn't help much. Handmaidens like them would be somewhat troublesome, especially for cultivators like him. If he beckoned them from the mountain at the back, it would take them practically forever to arrive. To take a round trip to the mountain only to come back dog-tired every time wouldn't be a sustainable solution. Like Yang Qing, with two cultivation handmaidens by his side, it would be much more convenient for him to do anything, and they could even serve as personal bodyguards. Especially after witnessing how Xue'er nearly had an accident when she touched the jade plate, he took the matter more seriously. "Where can I get a set of cultivation arts for the two of them?" Miao Yi asked. Yan Xiu contemplated for a moment before saying, "Complete cultivation techniques are the foundation of various sects' legacies and are not passed on to outsiders. Moreover, they are taught in stages to control disciples within the sect. Obtaining them would be quite difficult. "If there's a chance to go to the Flowing Cloud Dune Sea, it's a lawless area. Many cultivators who can't find footing within the Six Sages Domain tend to gather there. Demons, monsters, and all sorts of creatures mix together. It's common for people to engage in shady deals, and it's possible to buy techniques for a hefty price. However, there's no guarantee that the cultivation technique that hasn't been cultivated will be complete. It's even possible that you might go berserk. "After all, most cultivators keep the cultivation techniques memorized in their heads. Even if they carried it with them, they would add personal touches only they could understand to prevent the cultivation technique from being leaked." "Flowing Cloud Dune Sea..." Miao Yi muttered to himself as he thought of the flirtatious woman he had met at Miao Fa Temple. He shook his head and said, "That place is too far away. Who would go there for an adventure without good reason? Plus, as you mentioned, it's not safe. Is there no other way?" Yan Xiu shook his head. "It's very difficult! In order to control the number of cultivators in the world, there are strict measures against the underground trade of cultivation techniques! Such occurrences are only possible in places like the Flowing Cloud Dune Sea. He didn't explicitly say who imposed the measures, but Miao Yi immediately understood that he was referring to the Six Sages. The Six Sages didn't want to see too many people share the power of will in the world. If everyone sought to gain this power, it would lead to unrest and threaten the existing order. The Six Sages would not allow anyone to jeopardize their position. Miao Yi frowned and asked, "In that case, where did the Manor Head's handmaidens obtain their cultivation techniques?" "Naturally, the Manor Head imparted his own cultivation technique to them. It's usually like that." At that, Yan Xiu asked curiously, "Cave Master, why don't you impart your cultivation technique to the two of them? You can impart it to them step by step according to their comprehension abilities." That sounded nice, but in reality, Yan Xiu was suggesting that Miao Yi follow the same approach as other sects, gradually teaching them in stages. That way, he could also maintain control over his two handmaidens.
