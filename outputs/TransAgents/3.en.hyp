Chapter 189: The Affairs of the Supervisory Lord and the Dowager 64 Xiao Mo felt a profound sorrow seizing her heart for a moment. The Supervisory Lord... He appeared paralyzed by indecision. To move would be to face the truth, and with his sharp intellect, how could he not know that Bai Weiwei had departed from this world? Yet, he chose denial, convincing himself she was merely asleep and would soon awaken. Xiao Mo believed that only when Bai Weiwei's body began to decay would Supervisory Lord Mu Yanjun be forced to confront reality, recognizing that the person he was holding had long passed. Oddly, her body showed no signs of decomposition. Her pallor had even improved slightly, and though cold, she appeared to be in nothing more than a deep slumber, without any of the typical signs of a corpse. Mu Yanjun kept a silent vigil, his gaze ablaze with a desperate need for answers. Eventually, Elder Zao, the Divine Doctor, was brought before him. With a Heart-guarding Elixir on his tongue, he mused, 'Half my life is already behind me.' Five days had passed since Mu Yanjun had last slept, and although his exhaustion was evident, his mind was alarmingly lucid. 'She has been this way since I administered the Heart-guarding Elixir. I need to know when she will wake,' he stated. Elder Zao sighed and took Bai Weiwei's pulse. 'This condition is exceedingly rare; she requires no further treatment. However, there is one more crucial task...' Mu Yanjun listened with the intensity of a keen student, his eyes burning with the urgency of his need. Elder Zao's voice fell to a whisper, 'It's time I attended to another...' As Mu Yanjun leaned in, Elder Zao's hand moved with lightning speed, inserting a needle into his neck. His eyes shot open, betraying a flicker of the fierce spirit within, hand reaching for Elder Zao's crown of the head. Xiao Mo intercepted, stopping Mu Yanjun's retaliatory strike. In the ensuing scuffle, Mu Yanjun's strength ebbed away, and he slipped into unconsciousness. Elder Zao, relieved, touched his head, 'That was too close. My time may not be long, but if he wakes with his sanity intact, that's all we can hope for.' There was no hope of reviving Bai Weiwei. Mu Yanjun was a shell of himself, his heartbreak manifesting as physical decline. Without intervention, he might soon join Bai Weiwei in death. Xiao Mo faced Elder Zao with a stern warning, 'You hold the life of our Supervisory Lord in your hands. If you fail him again, I personally will end your life.' She then turned and left to accept her punishment in silence. Elder Zao exhaled, 'My master was right; selling sweet potatoes is better than being hailed as a Divine Doctor. Everyone expects miracles, but not even a god can make one who longs for death cling to life.' After only two hours, Mu Yanjun's eyes opened once more. Panic flickered across his face as he realized he was immobilized. 'I've administered acupuncture,' Elder Zao explained. 'Your spirit is greatly weakened. With some rest, you'll be on your way to meet King Yama, the mythological judge of the dead.' Mu Yanjun's eyes darkened, his visage gaunt and his aura menacing. Elder Zao prepared another needle, 'I had no intention of saving you, for someone with a heart as dark as yours might only bring about further chaos upon being revived.' Mu Yanjun's voice was soft yet unsettling, 'Release me.' Elder Zao shook his head, 'That I cannot do. Though I could not save your beloved, saving you is my atonement.' A bitter laugh escaped Mu Yanjun, 'Your atonement is meaningless. You could heal the entire world, and it would not equate to a single hair from her head.' Chapter 190: The Affairs of Supervisor Master and the Empress Dowager (Conclusion) Old Master Zao: "You're not foolish; you know very well that she's already dead." Mu Yanjun's body shook with uncontrollable tremors, the needles targeting his vitals unable to restrain him any longer. Seeing this, Old Master Zao had no choice but to insert a few more needles. "Her case was quite unique; you were too late, and the medicine didn't have time to take effect before she died. Thus, all the medicinal strength went into preserving her body, keeping it from decaying for years unless burned. Besides being cold, she looked no different from someone in a peaceful slumber." Old Master Zao sighed deeply at this point, "Upon hearing this, the Emperor had her body taken away to be cremated." Mu Yanjun, realizing the Emperor's intentions, uttered a series of 'good' in a cold and mocking tone, "Anyone who tries to take her away from me will not live to see another day." As he spoke, the needles burst from his body one by one, and blood surged from the punctures. Old Master Zao understood that his own end was approaching. From ancient times, the deepest wounds have always been inflicted by love. Free from the Divine Doctor's Acupuncture Shackles, Mu Yanjun leapt into action, heading straight for the exit. Old Master Zao braced for his end, but Mu Yanjun, preoccupied with a more pressing matter, vanished before inflicting a fatal blow. The elder shakily took a Heart-guarding Elixir, "My life won't be long. Such cruelty from Mu Yanjun... To not kill me instantly, does he intend to torture me slowly?" A massive pyre had been set up in front of the palace. Bai Weiwei lay amidst the firewood, her tranquility and softness akin to someone in a deep sleep. Xiao Mo, with eyes reddened from weeping, was filled with silent rage. He rasped out, "Commence the funeral rites for my mother, the Empress Dowager." Aside from Mu Yanjun, everyone inside the palace had accepted that it was time to bid Bai Weiwei farewell. Mu Yanjun's followers, believing their Supervisor Master had become obsessively infatuated, allowed the Emperor to proceed with burning Bai Weiwei's body. The fire blazed instantly. Xiao Mo, unable to bear the sight, fell to his knees, sobbing uncontrollably. But before the flames could reach Bai Weiwei's body, a shadowy figure hurtled toward the pyre, fearlessly diving into the flames. It emerged with Bai Weiwei's body in tow, leaping out of the fire. Upon recognizing the figure, Xiao Mo, filled with loathing, screamed, "Mu Yanjun, may you be cursed! You caused my mother's death, and now you even seek to tarnish her corpse. You're inhuman." Mu Yanjun, holding Bai Weiwei, his hair tips and clothes charred but her body unharmed, replied indifferently, "It appears the vermin dare to trample over me. It's time to cleanse the palace." With that declaration, Mu Yanjun descended into darkness, relinquishing any remaining shred of humanity, returning to his former self: sinister, merciless, the sovereign known as Nine Thousand Years. The Emperor was confined. Within the palace, those who were to be killed were executed, and the complicit were purged. Particularly those who had conspired to send Bai Weiwei's body to the flames, whether they were Mu Yanjun's confidants or not, were executed without exception. Mu Yanjun refused to show any more compassion; he treated the Emperor as a puppet and the world as a slaughterhouse. Murder became his sole pleasure. Mu Yanjun, gazing outside at the blood-drenched grounds, gently stroked Bai Weiwei, who lay in his embrace, his voice soft but ominous, "Weiwei, see how I've spilled blood again today. Will you not entreat me for mercy, and I might stop?" Bai Weiwei remained still as ever. Mu Yanjun's smile was a mask for his sorrow, "Your silence leaves me no choice but to continue." He had once vowed that if she dared to die, he would drag everyone to hell with her as her burial companions. Embracing her icy body, Mu Yanjun whispered enticingly, "I am indeed a wretched man, but if you were willing to teach me, perhaps I could change." Enveloped in grief, he rested his head against her cold neck, tears tracing a silent path down his cheeks. "Why do you refuse to give me a chance to become better?" Chapter 191: Reality 1 When Ye Yuxuan struggled to rise from his bed, he was soaked through with sweat. His body was wracked with shivers, and his face was ghostly pale. Succumbing to an unbearable urge, he hugged himself, teeth gritted as though trying to scream out someone's name. Yet, after many silent murmurs, he couldn't vocalize the name of the woman haunting his dreams. His heart raced; with closed eyes, he could see the spreading flames of his nightmares, threatening to consume him at any moment. He looked down at his hands as if still cradling her. The joy, sorrow, and anger he felt were slowly fading, but the love etched deep in his bones seemed to have been transmitted to him from a man named Mu Yanjun. Ye Yuxuan knew he had been off-kilter lately, and this disconcerting change was now stirring his emotions. For example, he was currently grappling with an unfamiliar sensation... was it sadness? His chest ached as if pierced through, yet after exhaustive examinations with every imaginable instrument, no physical ailments were found. Lost in thought, Ye Yuxuan lingered in bed a while longer before finally rising. As he did so, a servant approached and whispered, "Doctor Qin has arrived." Ye Yuxuan nodded slightly, requesting the servant brings him a glass of water, and then he descended the stairs, holding the glass. Upon reaching the bottom, he noticed the front door of his home was open; Qin Qiu was directing a team of medical personnel who were carrying medical equipment inside. Ye Yuxuan observed quietly, his dark eyes betraying no ripple of emotion. Qin Qiu, catching sight of Ye Yuxuan, was accustomed to his stoic façade and hurriedly greeted him, "My room is still available, right?" Ye Yuxuan nodded, "Isn't your room always reserved indefinitely?" Having many rooms in his residence, and Qin Qiu being a regular visitor, one had been permanently set aside for him. "I know," Qin Qiu replied, "which is why I'm making temporary use of it." Ye Yuxuan remained mute. Without prompting, Qin Qiu added, "You think I'm here to stay, but you'd be wrong. I'm swamped with hospital affairs; I couldn't possibly live here full-time." Ye Yuxuan couldn’t even muster a hum in response. Qin Qiu continued, "So, I've offered my room to your fiancée." Ye Yuxuan took a beat before responding evenly, "Bai Weiwei?" "Exactly," Qin Qiu confirmed, "I've already had her settled in. Old Master Zao suspects many problems within his household, particularly after Bai Weiwei's abduction from the hospital two days ago. He feels he can't trust anyone around him, so he's entrusted Bai Weiwei to you for the time being. You are her betrothed, aren't you?" Ye Yuxuan reflected for a moment, "I lack the time to tend to a patient." "She's your fiancée," Qin Qiu reminded him. Ye Yuxuan nodded, "Then I suppose I don't need a fiancée." Qin Qiu, clearly shocked, exclaimed, "What?" "If you wish to bring her here, that's fine, but you will have to look after her," Ye Yuxuan declared. Qin Qiu exploded, "She is not my fiancée!" With an air of nonchalance, Ye Yuxuan suggested, "Then I'll gift her to you." Qin Qiu felt a surge of frustration that threatened to spew forth like a fountain of old blood. Ye Yuxuan was not suited for a fiancée; he was more fit to be paired with a machine. Qin Qiu resolved to stop engaging with this emotionally stunted individual. He needed tranquility—no, he needed to arrange Bai Weiwei's accommodation. Given her delicate health and uninterrupted slumber, she required constant care and medical equipment to sustain her life. Efficient as ever, Qin Qiu set up the equipment, and after confirming Bai Weiwei's condition was stable, he instructed the caregiver to maintain a vigilant watch overnight. Exiting the room, Qin Qiu encountered Ye Yuxuan, who was still seated on the living room sofa with his water glass in hand, seemingly enshrouded in deep contemplation. Chapter 192: Reality 2 Qin Qiu's throat was parched, and after a servant brought him water, he took a large gulp before inquiring, 'Having trouble sleeping?' Ye Yuxuan gave a slight nod, 'There's something I need to mull over.' Qin Qiu settled onto the sofa across from him, sipping water as he asked, 'What's troubling you? Is the company in jeopardy?' Ye Yuxuan maintained a calmness that belied the gravity of his thoughts, 'I'm wrestling with the notion... Would I ever desecrate her remains?' Qin Qiu choked on his water, 'Desecrate her remains!' Ye Yuxuan, unaffected, continued, 'In the dream, I encountered that man, tormented by the urge to commit such an atrocity. It's unsettling.' Qin Qiu interjected, 'Hold on, what bizarre dream did you have this time?' A rare haze of confusion drifted across Ye Yuxuan's expression as he confided, 'I dreamt of her passing, yet her body remained as though she were merely sleeping, possessing a certain... charm.' Qin Qiu's voice took on a mockingly playful tone, 'Charm?' Ye Yuxuan describing someone as charming was as unlikely as the heavens collapsing. Ye Yuxuan emphasized, 'Exactly, charming,' before he resumed, 'And the man in my dream, he was repeatedly on the brink of defiling her. But each time, he was somehow restrained by her serene countenance.' — Sequel to 'Affairs of the Supervisor Master and the Empress Dowager': Mists rose from the hot springs, shrouding the area where a delicate and alluring figure lay quietly by the water, her black hair trailing in the pool, undulating like seaweed. Mu Yanjun's cheeks were flushed, his gaze burning with a frightening intensity. He fought with his self-control for a long while before finally releasing her, resisting the most heinous of impulses. He pondered over when this obsession had begun. Was it the sight of her unresponsive, lifeless body that had seen his mind fray, warp into something monstrous? He had tried every means to stop himself, yet in the end, he couldn't resist peeling away her clothes. Only when his skin met her cool flesh did he truly feel alive. Murder no longer stirred any emotion in him. She was dead. He was acutely aware of that fact. He also knew just how dark and terrifying he was for not laying her to rest. The moment the Little Emperor, at just six years old, preferred to incinerate her body rather than let him have it, could have been a premonition of the vile acts he was capable of. Several times he nearly yielded, but each time he gazed at her peaceful face, he refrained. He feared that if he went further, she might become enraged, might reject him. They were wed, except for the consummation. Still, he didn't dare to take the gamble. Mu Yanjun managed to quell the inferno within himself, avoiding the ultimate transgression. After washing and dressing her with meticulous care, he lifted her and left the chamber. The palace was empty, the servants scattered. When he discovered that the Little Emperor was amassing forces, ready to assert his autonomy, he didn't stand in his way. At times, he even lent his support. The Emperor had grown; Mu Yanjun figured he was now sixteen. Ten years had flown by, a decade he had spent guarding Bai Weiwei's cold remains. How swiftly time had passed, yet how painfully slow it seemed. Clutching Bai Weiwei, Mu Yanjun moved slowly towards the palace entrance, where he was met by a strikingly tall, armored young man wielding a sword, leading the imperial guards outside the palace. The youth's face was stern and handsome. Pointing his sword at Mu Yanjun, he declared fiercely, 'Traitor Mu, return my mother, the Empress, and I may yet allow you a dignified demise.' Chapter 193: Reality 3 The Little Emperor grew up swiftly, subsisting in a life of indignity beneath Mu Yanjun's oppressive presence. It was within this deep humiliation that he bloodily clawed his way up to power and authority, and now, he finally wielded a sword, ready for vengeance. Mu Yanjun's visage was the picture of calm as he tenderly smoothed a strand of Bai Weiwei's hair, tousled by the wind, tucking it behind her ear. His gaze was suffused with an ineffable softness, then he turned his eyes to the Little Emperor. 'Do you persist? She has been mine from the very beginning; what makes you think you have any right to her?' The Little Emperor's eyes blazed with fury, his every word heavy with vehemence, 'My mother has departed this world. Respect is due to the deceased. How can you—how dare you—cling to her remains, denying her spirit tranquility and rebirth?' The entire palace was aware of how Mu Yanjun had shared living quarters, even a bed, with the late Empress Mother. The Little Emperor, privy to Mu Yanjun's clandestine actions, loathed the vile thoughts this man had for his mother. 'You proclaim your love for my mother incessantly, yet your deeds only degrade her. How do you have the gall to profess love?' The Little Emperor's voice nearly broke under the weight of his grief, cursing his own powerlessness to shield Bai Weiwei and lamenting the cruel fate that denied her a funeral befitting her stature. Mu Yanjun regarded the Little Emperor with a gaze dark as the abyss, a smile then breaking the stillness, 'I did it purposefully. I have heard that by withholding a body's burial, the soul remains shackled to it.' The Little Emperor suddenly remembered that this traitor, Mu Yanjun, had once summoned high monks to the palace. As expected, he heard Mu Yanjun continue with a sinister chuckle, 'I had the monks cast the Soul-locking Talisman. If souls do persist post-mortem, she will be unable to escape me, eternally bound to remain by my side.' The Little Emperor shook with unchecked rage, his eyes red as blood, 'Mu Yanjun, is this your manner of loving someone? You are beyond deranged.' Mu Yanjun's smile widened grotesquely, his madness laid bare, 'I've been a madman for ages. Even in death, she shall not be free of me. I desire her to be entwined with me, life after life.' The Little Emperor commanded with fevered urgency, 'Break through and capture him!' He would find no peace until Mu Yanjun was torn asunder. Yet before anyone could move, flames surged forth. The palace, previously soaked in oil, ignited with a single spark, fanned by the wind, into a towering inferno. To escape the flames, all retreated. The Little Emperor beheld Mu Yanjun amidst the blaze, clutching Bai Weiwei, and impulsively, he surged toward the flames. His aides immediately grasped him, their urgency palpable, 'Your Majesty, you must not enter! The flames are insurmountable. If you enter, you will not survive!' The Little Emperor, driven by desperation and disregarding his own safety, screamed at Mu Yanjun, 'Mu Yanjun, unhand her, I implore you with all my being, release her!' The conflagration would persist, unquenched, until all was ash. Mu Yanjun held Bai Weiwei close; as the flames consumed them, they became inseparable. Upon hearing the Little Emperor's plea, Mu Yanjun glanced up and smiled. In the fire's glow, his smile was one of unspeakable release and relaxation, enhancing the vivid allure of the Tear Mole beneath his eye, a mark believed to be laden with sorrowful beauty. Then, cradling Bai Weiwei, he turned and resolutely stepped into the inferno's embrace. In life, they were separated, but in death, they would merge; their ashes inseparable. For ten years, he had yearned to become one with her, halting just before the final act. He knew that even if he possessed her body, it would be but an empty shell. If there were another life, and she learned of his depraved desires, she might never desire him again. Now, in death, they would burn together, unable to be torn apart, eternally united. Chapter 194: Reality 4 Mu Yanjun couldn't help but embrace her even more tightly as the flames began to consume their bodies. He gazed down at her, and resting his head against her neck, murmured softly, "I miss you so much, Weiwei." --- Qin Qiu held his throbbing head, perplexed by the absurdity. "Eventually, the Little Emperor became too frustrated to separate their ashes and had no choice but to inter them together in a single urn," Ye Yuxuan went on. Qin Qiu dismissed it with a wave of his hand, "You've definitely got issues lately." Ye Yuxuan conceded, "I know." Qin Qiu asserted, "You've become twisted from holding back, hence these twisted dreams. You’ve been dreaming about romance non-stop lately—no point in denying it. You're just love-starved." Ye Yuxuan looked at him silently. Qin Qiu slapped his hands together emphatically, "Why the look? If not for this, why else the weird dreams? You haven’t been near a woman in years, not to mention barely intimate. What man lives like that?" Ye Yuxuan spoke calmly, "It doesn’t seem like a dream, but rather like it's real." Qin Qiu blurted out, "Your delusions have gotten that bad? To the point where you mistake dreams for reality?" Ye Yuxuan, tired of persuading, stood up, "I’m going to the office." Qin Qiu grabbed him, "Why head to the office at 4 A.M.? You should be seeking a relationship, breaking this eternal bachelor spell. I’ve seen my share of guys like you, all pining for a woman to the point of insanity." Ye Yuxuan struggled to free his hand, but Qin Qiu's grip was firm. Qin Qiu went on, "You should meet your fiancée, start dating, and then naturally progress to the more intimate things. That way, you won’t constantly have these frustrated dreams." Ye Yuxuan commanded, "Let go." Qin Qiu encouraged, "Don’t be bashful, lad. I’ve been through it—I get the torment of never having been in love..." Ye Yuxuan interjected, "Eternal bachelor, let go." Qin Qiu stood shocked, as if electrocuted. With ease, Ye Yuxuan overcame his overbearing friend, turned without expression, and left for the company at dawn. Qin Qiu clutched his chest, "Ye Yuxuan, I shouldn’t have saved your future wife. You deserve to taste the bitterness of solitude." Once Ye Yuxuan had left, Qin Qiu sighed, feeling years older. He decided to check on Bai Weiwei, who was still asleep. But just as he opened the door, he heard the nurse’s voice, "Miss Bai, hold on, you can't remove the needle like that." Bai Weiwei was beyond caring; her current objective was to destroy the System. The accursed System had exchanged her month's worth of life points for a Life Extension Elixir, depleting an entire month's worth of her lifespan. This, on top of the Life Safety Subsidy from the previous Plane, meant a deduction of five days' worth of life points. She woke up to the reality of being in debt to the System for five days of life, which immediately triggered her heart condition. In a desperate move to keep her alive, the System automatically used the Life Extension Elixir, securing ten days of life. After more deductions, only five days were left. Following further deductions, a mere hour remained. From five days, or one hundred and twenty hours, it had dwindled to just one hour. She was determined to obliterate the System; it was clear who had played a hand in this. The System tried to soothe her, "Host, please stay calm." Bai Weiwei snapped, "Calm your own nerves." The System attempted consolation, "See the bigger picture. It's only a few life points. Don’t take it to heart." Bai Weiwei exploded, "Bigger picture? You’d better shut it, or I'll stuff you into a beer bottle and smash it with a hammer." Chapter 195: Reality 5 The System immediately fell silent. Bai Weiwei didn't have the luxury to inquire about what had specifically reduced her lifespan to a mere hour; she had more pressing matters at hand. She leapt from the bed and hurried to the door, only to find Qin Qiu staring at her in astonishment. Having met him a few times in his role as the hospital director, she didn't waste a moment and asked, "Qin Qiu, a pleasure to see you. Where are we?" Upon waking in a strange room, she speculated if this was some super VIP hospital ward. Qin Qiu immediately explained, "This is your fiancé’s house. Your father wishes for you both to cultivate a deeper bond... Good heavens, what are you undertaking?" Bai Weiwei's hand had shot out, snatching at his clothes with the urgency of a wolf cornering its prey. She couldn't spare a second for his words, and promptly fished out a mobile phone from his pocket, dialing her father with frantic urgency. As soon as the call connected, she blurted out, "Father, that wretched Bai Yaoyao is trying to kill me. My heart condition flared up, and she tampered with my medicine, aiming to usurp my fiancé, my position at the company, and everything I own. I narrowly survived; previously, she even had the audacity to get that scoundrel An Le to abduct me with the intent to drown me. You'd better get someone to restrain her, and then when I get back..." She halted briefly, then continued forcefully, "...when I return, I intend to slap her senseless, to hammer into her that a wild hen can never transform into a phoenix. Even if she somehow managed to become one, I would pluck her feathers and cook her in a stew." There was a long pause on the other end as her words were processed. Then, a soft giggle came through, "Sister, I'm at a loss as to what you're talking about. Could it be that your illness has taken a toll on your sanity?" A shiver ran down Bai Weiwei's spine—Bai Yaoyao? "Where's Father?" she asked sharply. "Our father? He's asleep. You shouldn't disturb him so late at night," Bai Yaoyao replied with a veneer of concern. Bai Weiwei's voice turned frosty, "What are you scheming?" "My scheme? I'll tell you plainly: I want you dead. Will you oblige by dying?" Bai Yaoyao sneered. Bai Weiwei took a deep breath, "He's your father too. Don't hurt him." "My father? Reflect on this—has Bai Changyan ever held me in anything but disregard? In his eyes, you are his precious gem, while I am nothing more than a weed. If you were in trouble, he'd be beside himself with worry, but if I died, would he even bat an eyelid?" Bai Yaoyao retorted bitterly. Bai Weiwei was now outside her room, facing the lavishness of an unfamiliar mansion—a vast living room crowned by an extravagant crystal chandelier. The butler maintained his nightly vigil, and the servants glided silently to and fro. The front door, apparently custom-designed, was impenetrable without permission. Could this be Ye Yuxuan's residence? It was only then she spared a thought for her distant and entirely ineffective fiancé—a man whose wealth rivalled that of nations. "Name your price. As long as you don't harm Father, I agree to anything," Bai Weiwei's voice revealed her Achilles' heel—her father. Despite Bai Changyan's youthful missteps, which had led to Bai Yaoyao's birth, he had lavished Bai Weiwei with all his affection. A gleeful chuckle came from Bai Yaoyao, "My sister, my always majestic and unapproachable sister, have you finally stooped to pleading with me? I'm at home right now, with our beloved father right beside me." As Bai Weiwei approached the formidable door, Bai Yaoyao's voice, still dripping with arrogance, continued to echo in her ear. "Father's strapped to a bomb, and now you must choose. Will you trade your life for his, or will you watch as he meets his fate?" Chapter 196: Reality 6 Bai Weiwei closed her eyes, mustering serenity amidst the storm of her emotions. When she reopened them, they were alight with a fierce resolve. 'I choose to trade my life for it.' Qin Qiu had just entered the room when he was struck by Bai Weiwei's solemn words. His face etched with confusion, he asked, 'What's going on?' Without turning, Bai Weiwei ordered, 'Open the gate; I require your automobile.' Sensing the gravity in Bai Weiwei's tone, Qin Qiu promptly instructed the servants to open the gate, then fetched his car. Bai Weiwei was quick on his heels. As Qin Qiu was about to open the car door, she pushed him aside, seized the driver's seat, slammed the door, and the vehicle lunged forward, a flurry of actions executed with a desperate precision. By the time Qin Qiu recovered, the car was but a speck in the distance. In disbelief, he chased after his car, shouting, 'Bai Weiwei, you owe me a phone!' Without it, how could he continue his battles in the world of 王者荣耀? --- Ye Yuxuan's dwelling lay about an hour's journey from her own. Bai Weiwei drove as if the reaper itself were at her heels. When she arrived, the System intoned, 'Ten minutes remain.' Was it too much to ask for a little more time in this world? What dark purposes did the System have for her life points? She had yet to live through an entire day. Bai Weiwei bypassed the need for keys with her fingerprint, and stepped into the silence of her home. The usual flurry of attendants was nowhere to be seen. Had Bai Yaoyao released them all? Bai Weiwei's heart raced. If not for the life points enhancing her physicality, she might have succumbed to a heart attack by now. Abruptly, Bai Yaoyao materialized at the stairway, 'Sister, you've returned.' Bai Weiwei's eyes were two chips of ice, 'Where is father?' Bai Yaoyao gazed at her with feigned tenderness, 'Father has succumbed to the lull of sleeping pills; his suspicion runs deep. It was only after much effort that I was able to coax him into slumber.' Bai Weiwei ascended, 'You crave my death; what do you intend to do? Would you have me leap from a window, or would you prefer to slash my face and stab me repeatedly until your fury is quenched?' Bai Yaoyao suddenly backed away, 'Please, no closer, sister. Your special abilities terrify me.' Immune to poison, cars that defy gravity. While she deemed these events ludicrous, she couldn't deny the fear they instilled. As Bai Weiwei paused, the System's cold voice cut through, 'Three steps remain, hurry, Weiwei, ascend.' Unanticipated guidance from the System left her puzzled. What did 'three steps remain' mean? In that moment of uncertainty, she chose to heed the System's urgency. Bai Yaoyao's expression contorted, 'Stop!' Only a few paces more and Bai Weiwei would be within arm's reach. But Bai Weiwei surged forward, and as she did, the System chimed, 'Ding, Lovey-Dovey Mode activation confirmed, effective for three minutes. Please revel in the blissful rapture.' Just as Bai Yaoyao was about to scream for An Le to end Bai Changyan's life, her consciousness was jolted by an imperceptible force, her pupils scattered. When she came to, her eyes shone with a disturbing adoration for Bai Weiwei. 'Sister, my love for you is boundless!' Bai Weiwei, momentarily stunned by the bizarre turn of events, watched as Bai Yaoyao lunged for an embrace. Startled, Bai Weiwei repelled her with a kick. As Bai Yaoyao crumpled to the floor in a heap, she looked up in a blissful daze, 'To strike is to love, to scold is to cherish; sister, please kick me again.' Bai Weiwei, obliging her warped wish, shoved her away with her foot. 'Be gone, you lunatic.' Chapter 197: Reality 7 As An Le emerged, he was met with the sight of Bai Weiwei expelling Bai Yaoyao with a forceful kick. He immediately drew out the remote control for the bomb. Rushing to Bai Yaoyao's side, he wrapped her in his arms and warned Bai Weiwei, 'I implore you to reconsider. With a mere press of this button...' Bai Weiwei, teeth clenched in anger, retorted, 'An Le, you ingrate, you know well the kindness my father has shown you. To stoop to such lows for this harlot...' Before An Le could articulate a defense, Bai Yaoyao, seething with fury, sprang to her feet and twisted An Le's cheek with a slap. 'You've vexed my sister; now feel the wrath of the Love Peach, a slap born from affection, just for you.' An Le: '...' Bai Weiwei: '...' With an affectionate gaze towards Bai Weiwei, Bai Yaoyao delivered another slap to An Le's other cheek. 'Sister, even my strikes are shaped by the love I bear for you.' Bai Weiwei felt an upsurge of blood in her throat, a premonition of an impending heart attack. She needed her medication, and soon. An Le, face a picture of confusion, touched his cheek and muttered, '...' The System interjected nonchalantly, 'Upon my return, I witnessed those two miscreants tampering with the Life Extension Elixir for your father. With only ten days of life granted by the elixir, and five days already expended, a mere one hundred and twenty hours remain. Fearing that you might be threatened by these scoundrels upon your awakening, I had to exchange your life points for the Lovey-Dovey Package.' Bai Weiwei grasped her chest, 'Wouldn't it have been simpler to send Bai Yaoyao off to meet King Yama? Why implement such an absurd package?' The System sighed, 'We systems are governed by laws; we cannot directly take lives. Additionally, your financial constraints meant that you couldn't afford any offensive items. It was only during a discount that we managed to secure three precious minutes of the Lovey-Dovey Package with your remaining 119 hours. During those minutes, Bai Yaoyao's love for you will be as vast as the universe, and she will fulfill any command you give her.' After a moment's pause, the System voiced its concern: 'Your life is hanging by a thread, and the bomb still needs disarming. Once we navigate past this danger, we must proceed to the next task to ensure your survival.' Conscious that every second mattered, Bai Weiwei did not waver. She instructed Bai Yaoyao, 'Dismantle the bomb on my father.' The bomb had to be neutralized before Bai Yaoyao's life could be addressed. An Le, having previously experienced surreal events and now witnessing Bai Yaoyao's radical change, realized Bai Weiwei must be responsible. He seized Bai Yaoyao with both hands, 'Young Mistress, what sorcery have you wrought upon Yaoyao?' Bai Weiwei's countenance grew frosty, 'Do as commanded and remove the bomb from my father.' Her directive struck Bai Yaoyao like the Fireworks of Love, igniting a surge of immense strength within her. She upturned An Le effortlessly. 'Yes, my esteemed sister. Even the disarming of the bomb is an act shaped by my love for you.' Bai Yaoyao's face beamed with blissful fervor as she formed a large heart with her hands. With a sudden ferocious turn, she grabbed An Le by the collar, her expression monstrous. 'Did you not heed the words of our esteemed sister? Remove the bomb from our father.' Dread painted An Le's features, his voice laced with despair, 'Yaoyao, what venom has seduced your senses? Come back to reality. If the bomb is disarmed, you'll lose all your standing within the Bai family.' They had reached a point of no return. With Bai Changyan's life in jeopardy and Bai Weiwei's frailty, Bai Yaoyao's chance to dominate the Bai household was within reach. Suddenly, Bai Yaoyao was struck with a realization. She forcefully extracted the Self-defense Gun from An Le, pressing it beneath her chin, 'Proceed with the dismantlement, you oafish cur. Would you dare to disregard the orders of our dear sister? If you hesitate, I shall end my life before your very eyes.' Chapter 198: Reality 8 An Le was utterly shocked. Bai Weiwei added insult to injury, 'If he doesn't dismantle the bomb's remote control, kill him then kill yourself.' Bai Yaoyao's eyes brimmed with adoration, 'Yes, esteemed sister. I will certainly fire heart-shaped bullets; both murder and suicide will be in the shape of my love for you.' Bai Weiwei felt emotionally drained: She had no desire to converse with this love-struck simpleton, feeling as though her intelligence had plummeted to the earth's core. An Le, though distressed, couldn't allow Bai Yaoyao, bewitched by evil, to commit suicide. He had done everything for the sake of Bai Yaoyao. Bai Changyan, sedated with a heart-protecting pill, was in a profound slumber. Seeing her weary father lying there nearly brought Bai Weiwei to tears. Despite An Le's movements slowing down, the disassembly of the bomb's remote control was straightforward, and, before long, the task was completed. Bai Yaoyao gleamed, 'Sister, the bomb's remote control has been neutralized.' Bai Weiwei nodded, 'Well done. Now take him with you to death, farewell.' Tears of passion streamed down Bai Yaoyao's face, 'Even the manner in which you decree my death is so beautiful; enamored with you, I wish to become fireworks, to explode in the sky as symbols of my love for you.' Bai Weiwei: She wished she could cover her ears, damn your sentimentality. Bai Yaoyao, with a mix of satisfaction and wantonness, pointed the gun at An Le, 'Sister has decreed our end, farewell.' She fired the gun at An Le. However, in a critical moment, An Le ducked and rolled, evading the bullet, and with swift precision, he advanced on her and wrested the gun from her hands. His skills far surpassed Bai Yaoyao's. When serious, she was no match for him—not in the slightest. Bai Weiwei's expression changed; she knew that if An Le knocked out Bai Yaoyao, she and Bai Changyan would not escape An Le's malevolent grasp. And then, she heard the familiar warning from the system. 【Countdown: ten seconds... nine...】 Time was running out. Bai Weiwei's gaze hardened, she commanded Bai Yaoyao with urgency: 'Jump from the building, immediately, right now!' An Le was so obsessed due to his love for Bai Yaoyao. If Bai Yaoyao jumped, An Le would have no choice but to follow. As expected, without hesitation, Bai Yaoyao dashed towards the exit, 'Even in jumping, I shall express my love for you.' An Le bellowed, 'Yaoyao, what's gotten into you? Come to your senses!' He could no longer heed anything else, chasing after her desperately. Bai Yaoyao looked back, intent on jumping. Bai Weiwei quickly dialed a trusted associate at the company to protect Bai Changyan. She had forgotten this wasn't her phone, and in her urgency, dialed a familiar shortcut, not noticing the incorrect call history. As soon as the call connected, she urgently said, 'Hurry over, my father is in danger, Bai Yaoyao is the assailant, conspiring with An Le to murder him...' She hadn't finished speaking. A voice, cold and calm, came through. 'Who is this?' Bai Weiwei, startled, glanced at the phone, realizing her mistake in the frantic rush. There was no time for idle chat; she hung up and attempted to call the right person, but time had run out. 【The system gifts a Newcomer's Gift Pack, ding, unlocked, endowing the host with three days of life in a vegetative state, please complete the next task swiftly to ensure survival.】 Bai Weiwei finally lost her cool and yelled, 'Is this all you've got aside from newcomer packs?' Has the system become so destitute that it has nothing to offer but these basic bundles? Chapter 199: Reality 9 Ye Yuxuan stared at his phone, the voice on the other end striking a chord of recognition. Yet, in a fleeting moment of confusion, he couldn't place whose voice it was. He resumed his work, only to later recall that the number belonged to Qin Qiu. Redialing, he was immediately met with a barrage of anger. Qin Qiu's furious voice filled the line, 'Ye Yuxuan, listen, your fiancée's sister intends to kill her, to take her fiancé, her company, her position, everything. She even tried to drown her, and now she's targeting Bai Changyan's life. I'm at the hospital right now, Bai Yaoyao is attempting to jump off a building, Bai Weiwei is unconscious, and Bai Changyan has awakened...' Ye Yuxuan ended the call with unsettling composure. Was he losing the ability to distinguish dreams from reality? The voice from before, it was eerily similar to that of the woman in his dreams. But... Looking down at his phone, it was clear this was not a dream; Qin Qiu had indeed called twice. Seized by sudden urgency, he stood, grabbed his suit coat from the chair, and made a beeline for the exit. --- Qin Qiu arrived at the Bai residence just in time to witness Bai Yaoyao, joyously and stumblingly ascending the staircase, 'Sister, I love you, I love you, I love you, I'd leap from this building for you.' An Le chased after her, pleading, 'Yaoyao, come to your senses, you've been poisoned, subjected to deep hypnosis, what on earth have you taken? Don't jump off the building.' What on earth? Dumbstruck, Qin Qiu watched them sprint toward the highest floor, then hurried to find Bai Weiwei. Bai Weiwei lay pale and motionless beside the bed. Alarm struck Qin Qiu as he rushed to lift her into his arms. Anticipating danger, he had preemptively called for an ambulance and the police. After his call to Ye Yuxuan, the paramedics arrived, swiftly moving Bai Weiwei to the ambulance. Bai Yaoyao's leap was interrupted by an awning, resulting in severe trauma that necessitated immediate surgery. Bai Weiwei was stable, her vital signs steady, but she remained unconscious. Upon waking, Bai Changyan looked upon his daughter with a weary expression. The household's security footage had been sabotaged, leaving him in the dark about the incident. Nevertheless, his suspicions pointed to his second daughter's involvement in the recent turmoil. An Le was now confined, undergoing intense interrogation. When Ye Yuxuan arrived at the hospital, he found Qin Qiu sitting outside Bai Weiwei's room, silently shedding tears. Pausing, he stepped closer to Qin Qiu and inquired with a detached tone, 'What has happened?' Qin Qiu turned, phone in hand, 'I've just lost another ranked match.' Disregarding the remark, Ye Yuxuan pressed, 'To whom did you lend your phone earlier?' Qin Qiu replied, 'To Bai Weiwei.' Without a moment's delay, Ye Yuxuan pushed open the door to the room, and there, on the hospital bed, lay a woman. In her tranquil slumber, the toll of sickness was apparent, her once radiant beauty now drawn and pale. Her lips were devoid of color, her complexion pallid, and even her once glossy black hair had lost its vitality. Ye Yuxuan couldn't fathom his own reaction. Though he had seen her before, his betrothed, she had never made an impression on him. Qin Qiu, sensing the charged atmosphere, stepped inside. 'What are you looking at?' His gaze upon Bai Weiwei was intensely unsettling. After a moment of silence, Ye Yuxuan softly stated, 'When she awakens, I wish to hear her voice.' Her voice had, for a brief moment, stirred his dormant emotions, causing his steadfast heart to quiver. Chapter 200: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (1) Bai Weiwei regained consciousness to the sound of System's voice. [Your mission is to win Song Yunhuan's love. Target: Song Yunhuan, completion: zero percent. Time limit: four months.] She had no time to think further, for as she opened her eyes, she was confronted with a pair of eyes filled with disbelief and hatred. Startled, Bai Weiwei realized that her own hands had just forcefully pushed a person away. The man was young, his black hair catching stray beams of sunlight that crowned him with a ghostly aura. Underneath his disheveled hair was an exceptionally handsome face. That face now looked at Bai Weiwei with animosity as it fell from the vehicle. She instinctively reached out to grab his hand but only caught the sleeve of his clothing. Due to the forces of speed and gravity, the sleeve tore, and the man still fell, quickly disappearing into a group of fleshy... zombies? Bai Weiwei focused her eyes and inhaled sharply. She was standing on the edge of an open cargo truck, with people crowded inside. Outside, a horde of decaying zombies was fervently pursuing the truck. Each time a human tumbled from the truck, the undead horde descended like ravenous shadows, eager to feed. The man she had just pushed was now swallowed by the crowd of zombies, likely devoured completely. Then came the familiar notification from System. [Ding, the male lead's favorability has dropped to negative thirty-five. He harbors intense hatred for you, far more than for someone who would cold-heartedly betray you.] Bai Weiwei felt goosebumps. What was wrong with System, sounding as if it was taken over by the Lovey-Dovey Package? What was with this notification style? She then remembered something of utmost importance. Holding onto the piece of torn sleeve, she asked in confusion, "The man that this body just pushed out..." "Yes, that was the male lead," System cheerfully confirmed. Bai Weiwei felt the world tilt on its axis, reality blurring at the edges, realizing the blood on her metaphorical hands and the depth of the negative favorability she had accrued. Had she really just pushed the male lead to his death among the zombies? With the male lead gone, who was left for her to win over? Could this reality be... With a trembling voice, Bai Weiwei asked, "Ah Ling, this isn't some horror genre plane, is it?" System replied, "Just look at the zombies chasing after your truck; it's obvious to anyone that this is the Apocalyptic Zombie Plane." Bai Weiwei steadied herself, "But the person I'm supposed to charm has just been eaten by zombies." "Solving this dilemma is the host's duty, so good luck, my dear," System replied cheerfully, leaving Bai Weiwei reeling with revulsion. Had the System gone awry, possessed by the vengeful spirit of love that was Bai Yaoyao? System reminded her again, [Ding, please begin to integrate the memories of this body.] The familiar, otherworldly headache returned, as if memories were seeping into her mind through an invisible conduit, draining the color from Bai Weiwei's face. After the memories settled, she remained speechless for a long time. Her target, Song Yunhuan, and her current identity, Bai Weiwei, were college alumni. Bai Weiwei was admired for her delicate beauty and sweet voice, making her quite popular with the opposite sex. Song Yunhuan was a hermit, a tech guy who spent his days coding in his dorm. Although handsome, his gloomy nature did not endear him to women. The original Bai Weiwei and Song Yunhuan should have had no overlap in their lives. However, the previous Bai Weiwei was a deceptive seductress - outwardly pure, but inwardly reveling in the vanity of garnering men's favor with her woeful facade. Chapter 201: The Zombie King’s Irresistible Girlfriend (2) It was Song Yunhuan's enigmatic solitude that drew her gaze; not a single woman had succeeded in breaching his perimeter. To her, a man who disregarded the allure of women posed a tantalizing challenge. Thus, she boldly bet her dormmate that she could, in under a month, unravel this man—this unyielding stone who had forever been aloof to feminine charm. Song Yunhuan, a neophyte in the dance of courtship, was briefly spellbound by Bai Weiwei’s guise of innocence and hastily reciprocated her avowal of love. But their nascent romance wilted after a mere three days, its progress arrested at the threshold of a cinema outing, before Song Yunhuan pierced through Bai Weiwei’s deception. He even stumbled upon the wager she had struck with her dormmate. Branded by betrayal, Song Yunhuan broadcasted her manipulative schemes for all to see online and insisted on their immediate separation. In the wake of her humiliation, Bai Weiwei was poised to exact vengeance on Song Yunhuan when the cataclysmic outbreak of the doomsday virus and the relentless tide of zombies upended her plans. The duo, freshly untethered from their ill-fated romance, found themselves thrust into a harrowing escape. With a multitude clamoring for salvation and only one truck for refuge, Bai Weiwei was left scrambling for a foothold. A fleeting act of mercy from Song Yunhuan granted her passage aboard the truck; however, as the sting of his prior denouncement surged within her, retribution clouded her judgment, and she thrust the unsuspecting Song Yunhuan into the clutches of the voracious undead below. In the aftermath of her betrayal, Bai Weiwei was transposed to another reality. Bai Weiwei gazed at her hands in dismay—why had her reflexes failed her when it mattered most to save Song Yunhuan? With him now a feast for the zombies, who would be her next pawn? Was it conceivable to charm the zombies themselves? No, she must prioritize her own preservation. Perched precariously at the truck’s rear door, overburdened by the mass of desperate survivors, her ejection was imminent. Some had already commenced their covert nudging; her fate, if she fell, was to join Song Yunhuan in death. The system’s prompt broke through her thoughts, 'Side quest reward distribution, please accept, Host.' Bai Weiwei: 'Accepted.' What she desired was an apex skill for navigating the apocalypse—or, failing that, a sanctuary from the chaos. The system announced: 'Ding, Irresistible Charm trait delivered.' Bai Weiwei considered: Irresistible Charm trait... In this apocalyptic hellscape, what purpose could such an accursed charm serve? It paled in comparison to a 'Golden Finger'* ability that might allow her to live without the need for sustenance. An urgent shout from the truck’s vanguard pierced the tension, 'The truck won’t accelerate; the zombies will catch us at this rate!' Weighed down by an excess of survivors, the truck teetered on the brink of failure—a harbinger of a gruesome end for all aboard. 'Should we... let some people off?' Though the question was asked without an owner, it echoed the silent wish of everyone present. Yet, none wished to volunteer for the grim walk into the jaws of death. Bai Weiwei, standing at the edge of oblivion, was nearly pushed beyond the brink. Should a purge ensue, she would undoubtedly be the first sacrifice. Predictably, there were those among the crowd already plotting her expulsion. As Bai Weiwei’s face contorted with indignation, she recognized the instigator as a senior from her college days. A man who had seemed the epitome of mildness and decorum was now a portrait of duplicity and self-preservation. She was about to protest when a sudden gust of wind swept past her, and the system intoned, 'Ding, Irresistible Charm trait activated.' A vision of pink, heart-shaped bubbles with subtitles floated before her eyes. 【Her chestnut locks, kissed by the wind, framed her radiant visage, her eyes, clear and shimmering, held an enchanting light, as untouched and pristine as a young fawn...】 Bai Weiwei: What is this nonsense? The senior looked upon her, transfixed, a flush of red coloring his cheeks. Bai Weiwei, with a furrowed brow, poised to speak, when yet another sequence of pink subtitles appeared. 【Her brows drew together, her visage of striking beauty now wore a sorrow that invoked an instinctive desire to protect.】 Bai Weiwei: '...' *Golden Finger: A term often used in speculative fiction to describe a special ability or advantage that allows a character to overcome obstacles or achieve success in extraordinary ways. Chapter 202: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (3) The upperclassman's heart seemed to be ensnared by her melancholy as he abruptly took her hand. 'You shouldn't stand here; it's dangerously easy to fall. Let's move further inside.' Wasn't he about to push her off just moments ago? His attitude had changed with bewildering speed. The upperclassman cleared a path through the crowd, escorting Bai Weiwei deeper into the secure confines of the vehicle. Bai Weiwei observed the significant influence this upperclassman, Lin Xiao, wielded; many appeared fearful of him, and his commands were met with prompt obedience. In this apocalyptic setting, anyone else forcing their way into the vehicle would likely have incurred the wrath of the crowd, risking being cast out. They arrived at the very back. A small clique had formed here, with Lin Xiao as one of its key figures. He guided her to a seat in the most sheltered spot, 'Weiwei, take a seat here. Once the vehicle breaks out of the city, my uncle, a senior military officer, will come to retrieve us.' He then sat next to Bai Weiwei, his cheeks flushed with a timid yet ardent gaze. Bai Weiwei kept her silence, eavesdropping on discussions about who might be left behind. It became clear to her that Lin Xiao came from a powerful family, especially an uncle who was a high-ranking military official. This elite group, all scions of wealth and power, explained their preferential treatment amid the crisis. With the vehicle's fuel dwindling, it served as a temporary refuge, assured of rescue due to the presence of these influential heirs. As a scream pierced the air, Bai Weiwei's brow creased. She was about to interject when Lin Xiao reassured her, 'Don't be afraid. Such accidents are commonplace now, but you'll be safe.' Bai Weiwei looked at him quizzically. Were they that close? The original host's memories depicted Lin Xiao as reserved and gentle, someone who never mingled with their group. Could it be that Lin Xiao had harbored a secret affection for the Bai Weiwei of the past? Just as this thought crossed her mind, the pink subtitles popped up again. 【Her downcast beauty, as gentle as the clouds at dawn and the mist over the sea, seemed so fragile that it stirred a protective instinct, an instinctive yearning to protect, to envelop her in warmth...】 Lin Xiao's excitement surged, 'You have nothing to fear, I will protect you, and ensure that you are not harmed by the storm.' After a moment of speechlessness, Bai Weiwei tapped into the System, 'What's with these pink subtitles?' Only she could see them, triggering an intense embarrassment. System: 'That's the effect of your Charm Aura. To them, you're a figure of poignant beauty and unparalleled grace.' Bai Weiwei felt a wave of exhaustion, 'Can you block them?' These subtitles were insufferable, almost driving her to distraction. System: 'They're blocked. However, the effect remains. In my opinion, the subtitles add a touch of youthful charm.' Bai Weiwei: Or perhaps the charm of the naive. As Lin Xiao passionately vowed to protect her, the System issued a sudden warning. 【Ding, the Male Lead's favorability has dropped to negative forty.】 Bai Weiwei was taken aback. Was Song Yunhuan still alive? At that moment, from the zombie horde that had engulfed Song Yunhuan, the mindless undead began to emit a terrifying, hoarse cry. It was as if they were seized by fear, or perhaps issuing some sort of warning. The zombies contorted violently, their decaying bodies torn asunder by an immense spatial force. From the pile of rotting flesh and severed limbs, a pale, colorless hand appeared, covered in blood, slowly flexing. Then, he rose steadily to his feet, his face hauntingly handsome, with a ring of blood-red hue surrounding the black of his pupils. He began to laugh softly. The laughter was hoarse and eerie. 'Bai Weiwei, I am ravenous for you.' Chapter 203: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (4) As the vehicle descended into chaos, Bai Weiwei was prepared for such a situation. Overcrowded and crawling, not even Lin Xiao's status as a privileged second-generation authority figure could stem the tide of the disaster that was unfolding. Particularly when zombies managed to leap onto the roof, and passengers near the rear door were dragged away by the undead, mayhem erupted within the confines of the vehicle. Amidst cursing and weeping, passengers shoved one another, and many fell out. The number of zombies seemed to inexplicably grow, drawn to their vehicle despite the presence of other potential victims, leading to a terrifyingly vast horde in relentless pursuit. The sight was so daunting it could strike terror into the faint-hearted. Bai Weiwei turned to the System, 'Is there anything that can repel zombies?' The System excitedly affirmed, 'Of course! The Mighty Zombie-Killing Agent, your reliable ally in the apocalypse, effortlessly eliminates the undead. For your peace of mind, choose the Mighty Zombie-Killing Agent.' Bai Weiwei commanded, 'I'll take a bottle.' With the stakes at their highest, she could ill afford to worry about anything else; if zombies feasted on her, all her strategies would come to naught. The System countered, 'That item comes with a steep price tag; you can't afford it on credit.' Despair washed over Bai Weiwei's face. 'After all the missions I've undertaken, why can't I accumulate any life points? Are you skimming them off? Have you left me bereft of everything?' The System responded with a gravity unbecoming of its usual self, 'How could you have nothing left?' Bewildered, Bai Weiwei questioned what she had left. The System replied in a cheery tone, 'You've still got me!' Dubious, Bai Weiwei asked, 'Can you drive away zombies?' The System sent her a virtual kiss, 'Not exactly, but I can cheer you on. Go, go, go—sending you a heart gesture!' A surge of exasperation rose in Bai Weiwei, feeling as if she was on the verge of coughing up blood. This system, more a bane than a boon, seemed intent on aggravating her. Furthermore, the System's manner of speaking was unbearably inane. Suddenly, Lin Xiao seized Bai Weiwei's hand with earnest intensity, 'Weiwei, don't be afraid, I won't let anything happen to you.' Bai Weiwei was blissfully unaware of the peculiar illusion her irresistible allure had woven around Lin Xiao. He timidly proposed, 'Weiwei, once we find safety, let's get married, okay?' Bai Weiwei was speechless. Lin Xiao, blushing, continued, 'I've even thought up names for our children. Ideally, we'd have two—one boy like me and one girl like you... hehe, and when we're both old, we can sit together at sunset, still deeply in love, admiring the beauty of life.' A sharp pain struck Bai Weiwei's chest, as if the mere thought could trigger a heart attack. Suddenly, a resounding thud from above signaled something had landed on the roof. The vehicle swerved and skidded, sending Bai Weiwei lurching forward. Lin Xiao's swift reflexes saved her from falling; they were nearly tangled together. After the collision, the vehicle jolted violently, ejecting many passengers, and the zombies swarmed. The ensuing scene was brutally savage, with the thick stench of blood permeating the air. The vehicle slowed until, with a dying gasp, it came to a stop. Screams filled the air as the halted vehicle spelled a death sentence for all. Lin Xiao's reactions were astoundingly quick—he grabbed Bai Weiwei's hand, shoved others aside, leapt from the vehicle, and they ran for their lives. Chapter 204: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (5) Those who failed to disembark were immediately engulfed by the advancing horde of zombies. Bai Weiwei didn't glance back, yet the cacophony of zombie roars and human screams chased after her, painting a picture of a living hell. Lin Xiao bolted ahead, navigating towards the outskirts of the city where an abandoned commercial district beckoned. He said, 'Once we break through here, we can make it to the outskirts. My uncle is waiting there.' Bai Weiwei, however, abruptly released Lin Xiao's hand and said with composure, 'Go ahead, I can't keep up with your speed.' She was being truthful; she genuinely could not match his stride. Lin Xiao, evidently well-conditioned and robust, possessed a stamina that far exceeded hers. She had already reached her physical limit by keeping pace with him thus far. Her legs were leaden, and her heart was beating so fiercely it caused her chest pain. She was well aware of her physical endurance limit and knew she had hit it. Regardless of her irresistible allure, Lin Xiao's character seemed reasonably good, adhering to the 'save one's self if you can' philosophy. Lin Xiao turned back, his face awash with gratitude, 'You truly have a good heart. Not only do you have the most enchanting eyes in the world, but you also possess the kindest soul.' Bai Weiwei could no longer contain herself as Lin Xiao went on, 'How can you be so endearing, so lovely, so...' Smack! Bai Weiwei's hand connected sharply, silencing his flattery. A momentary peace fell upon Bai Weiwei's world. After dodging several more zombie encounters, Lin Xiao realized that he couldn't flee the city with the 'lovely encumbrance' that was Bai Weiwei. Despite her being the most delightful of burdens. After all, his life was of paramount importance. Tears brimming in his eyes, Lin Xiao bid his farewell, 'Weiwei, wait for me. I'll come back for you, goodbye.' He then bolted away. Bai Weiwei muttered to herself, 'May we never meet again.' The System urgently advised, 'Quick, there's a place to hide just ahead.' Driven by the System's guidance, Bai Weiwei sprinted ahead. Zombies lunged at her, emitting a stench of decay that nearly made her vomit. It almost felt as though the zombies were toying with her, deliberately slowing their pace whenever she thought they'd catch her. Bai Weiwei spotted the warehouse indicated by the System, rushed inside, slammed the door shut, and barricaded it with any heavy object she could muster. The pursuing zombies wailed and pounded on the door outside, their cries causing Bai Weiwei's hair to stand on end — the prospect of being bitten by one of these abominations meant certain suicide. Becoming such a hideous creature was an unacceptable fate for her. The warehouse door proved to be remarkably durable, thwarting the zombies' attempts to enter for the time being. Exhausted, Bai Weiwei slumped to the ground and complained to the System, 'I suspect that one of those zombies out there could be Song Yunhuan.' Surviving amidst the zombie swarm was highly unlikely for Song Yunhuan. If he were still alive, he surely would have become one by now. The System acknowledged, 'Possibly.' Bai Weiwei's despair deepened, 'The male lead I'm supposed to charm isn't meant to be a decaying monstrosity with protruding eyes, pus oozing from every orifice, and sparse hair, is he?' The System retorted, 'No matter what, he is the male lead. Even if his appearance has deteriorated, your task is to persevere.' Bai Weiwei had an epiphany, 'I just realized something.' The System queried, 'What is it?' Bai Weiwei replied, 'My favorability level is only at negative forty.' The System observed, 'Negative forty is quite substantial. Are you not content with such a low favorability, considering your exceptional talents?' Chapter 205: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (6) Bai Weiwei sighed, 'In the last plane, I began with a negative fifty, but in this one, after pushing Song Yunhuan into a horde of zombies, I'm only at negative forty. It's clear that a threat to his virility truly ignites a man's hatred.' [System]: Could the host's focus be slightly misplaced? This lighthearted exchange with the System was merely a distraction for Bai Weiwei from the dreadful reality outside—a world teeming with zombies, a nightmare for anyone. Bai Weiwei glanced at the door and felt a wave of relief, 'Thank goodness for this sturdy door, or I would have already been zombie fodder.' No sooner had she spoken than the door vibrated, its screws bursting out one by one. [Bai Weiwei and the System]: '...' Suddenly, with a thunderous kick, the door splintered into fragments that clattered to the floor. Bai Weiwei sat frozen, as a stream of sunlight poured through the now-open doorway. A tall figure loomed in the doorway, backlit by the brightness, his dark hair framed by a sinister halo, his face—a visage of twisted charm and malice. 'I've found you, Bai Weiwei.' His voice, raspy and unexpectedly seductive, broke the silence. Bai Weiwei's mind raced with thoughts, as she swiftly gauged her next move. With feigned terror, her voice quivering, she uttered, 'Song Yunhuan?' Song Yunhuan's gaze was opaque, the crimson in his eyes intensifying as he smiled, 'Yes, did you think I wouldn't make it back?' Tears cascaded down Bai Weiwei's cheeks, and after several choked sobs, she sprang to her feet, hurled herself towards him, and clung to him tightly. Her loud sobs echoed with a mix of relief, guilt, and catharsis, 'Song Yunhuan, you're alive! It's such a relief... I'm so grateful you didn't die.' Song Yunhuan's body was unyielding and icy, resembling the dead. He looked down at Bai Weiwei with a deepening smirk, 'I was under the impression you would take pleasure in my demise.' Bai Weiwei gave his chest a light punch, her voice laced with faux petulance, 'I did hope for your end. How could you be so heartless towards me? I've never cared for someone as deeply as I care for you. How could you treat me so cruelly?' Her tone was deliberately flirtatious, betraying the manipulative nature of her charade. Song Yunhuan appeared confused by her act, 'You care for me?' Bai Weiwei lifted tearful eyes, 'Are you implying something else? I've always harbored deep feelings for you. It took immense courage to become your girlfriend. Yet you spurn and slander me, turning my affection into loathing. I truly desired your death.' Song Yunhuan's sardonic smile widened, the red in his eyes growing darker, 'Love, is it?' Bai Weiwei bit her lip, her demeanor a mixture of defiance and naivety, 'Indeed. Do you think I relish liking you? Do you grasp how humiliating it is to fancy someone of your stature? Your family's destitute, you're introverted; my friends find you distasteful. I've always aspired to marry into affluence. How could I possibly fall for someone as destitute as you?' [System]: Such blatant shamelessness. Bai Weiwei's lower lip trembled, her tears on the verge of falling, 'Yet, I'm inexplicably drawn to you. I've convinced myself you're a hopeless case, that you can't offer the life I seek. Nevertheless, I'm attracted to you. Too proud to chase after you, I confessed because of a dare with my dormmate.' Song Yunhuan stood in silence, deep in thought. Bai Weiwei's cheeks flushed anew, 'I never expected you to agree to date me...' Song Yunhuan pondered silently. Bai Weiwei's tone became sorrowful again, 'Yet you never returned my affections, and in a moment of impulsiveness... I'm relieved you survived.' Song Yunhuan suddenly erupted in laughter, 'Do you genuinely adore me that much?' Bai Weiwei's face turned crimson, 'It's shameful to always be the one confessing.' Song Yunhuan reached out, pulling her to her feet with ease, his smile more radiant than ever, 'Then, let me reciprocate. I have a particular fondness... for the prospect of you being devoured by zombies.' With that, he flung Bai Weiwei out the door. Outside, a swarm of zombies awaited. Chapter 206: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (7) Bai Weiwei: "Has my irresistible charm become useless?" She had believed that her performance, enhanced by her irresistible charm, would soften Song Yunhuan's heart at least a little. It was then that the System found the chance to remind her: "Irresistible charm only works on those with a favorability rating above zero." Song Yunhuan's favorability stood at a calamitous negative forty. She couldn't just brush it off as simply negative forty anymore—negative forty was perilously high. Bai Weiwei tumbled to the ground, her hands scraping against the concrete to cushion her fall, flaying her palms until they bled. The zombies encircling her, as if they detected the scent of fresh flesh, excitedly howled and converged upon her. Bai Weiwei's pupils constricted, "Damned System, does my irresistible charm work on these things?" The System responded indifferently: "Irresistible charm isn't meant to bewitch a horde of zombies; it's ineffective against anything that lacks consciousness." Zombies that have not evolved are devoid of consciousness. At the outset of this apocalyptic era, the only evolved zombie was Song Yunhuan. Bai Weiwei: "So, this side quest reward, apart from maybe bewildering a random passerby, is essentially useless?" The System offered encouragement: "Once you elevate someone's favorability to above zero, the charm will become effective." Bai Weiwei roared in frustration: "How can I wait for that when I'm about to be devoured?" No sooner had she finished her dialogue with the System than a group of zombies lunged at her. Bai Weiwei executed a frantic roll on the ground, narrowly dodging the zombies' onslaught. Her eyes, filled with helpless despair, found Song Yunhuan's gaze. Song Yunhuan still smiled, standing bathed in sunlight, yet his eyes were cold with a sinister chill. The zombies, seemingly on command, intensified their attack on Bai Weiwei. With their mouths agape and foul teeth exposed, they rushed forward, eager to grasp her. Bai Weiwei realized there was nowhere to hide; the entire warehouse was swarmed by zombies. And within the warehouse, aside from Song Yunhuan, no zombie dared to approach. Bai Weiwei, preferring to be torn to shreds by Song Yunhuan rather than fed to the zombies, thought bitterly, 'At least Song Yunhuan is handsome.' Just as she reached the warehouse, her foot was caught by something, and she was violently thrown to the ground. A zombie's hand firmly grasped her calf, dragging her toward the outside. Bai Weiwei's fingers dug into the ground, her fingertips bleeding profusely. She felt the sharp nails of the zombie piercing into the flesh of her leg, as blood began to pour out. Shivering, she suddenly felt engulfed in shadow. Looking up, she saw Song Yunhuan looming above her, slowly squatting down, his handsome face twisted into a ghastly smile. The smile was tinged with a trace of malicious satisfaction. "Do you realize, Bai Weiwei, when you pushed me out, I felt just as you do now—hopeless with no escape, left to the zombies' gnawing hunger." Bai Weiwei's eyes welled up with tears, her voice quivering: "I apologize, Song Yunhuan." His smile warped for a moment, "Apologize for what? You, a woman of your nature, should epitomize selfishness; why bother apologizing to me?" As the zombie dragged her away, Bai Weiwei clawed at the ground with all her might, yet her eyes remained fixed on Song Yunhuan. "I'm sorry, Song Yunhuan. I know I'm not a good person. I'm selfish, vain, petty, and pleasure-seeking, yet it was not intentional. I didn't want you to die; I just wanted to frighten you. I never imagined failing to hold onto you." Bai Weiwei spoke through her sobs, unable to hold back her tears. With her last bit of strength, she stretched out and grabbed his hand. His sleeve ripped, leaving her holding onto a torn piece. Chapter 207: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (8) It was during Bai Weiwei's frantic efforts to pull him up that their bond began to tear. With every ounce of her strength, she gripped his hand, her face a canvas of guilt as she uttered, 'I'm sorry.' Song Yunhuan did not struggle; he allowed her to clutch his hand tightly. As Bai Weiwei's strength dwindled, it became clear that human might was no match for the zombies' overwhelming force, and she was at her very limit. Suddenly, Song Yunhuan's fingers tightened, clasping her own. A glimmer of hope, a touch of joy, sparked in Bai Weiwei's eyes. His voice was calm, even gentle by some measure, 'I believe you didn't intend any harm, but...' His thin lips curved up slightly, his eyes a dark abyss sending shivers down one's spine, 'What difference does it make?' With reluctance, he released his grip, finger by finger, allowing the light in Bai Weiwei's eyes to fade. As he let go, zombies dragged her out, their fingers digging into her calf, sending pain shooting up to her scalp. She was pulled out into the unforgiving sunlight, the zombies swarming, one after another, lunging at her. Bai Weiwei felt her skin tear on her legs, arms, back—zombies clawing and biting with relentless savagery. The System issued a dire warning: 'Alert, the host is in imminent danger, Life Safety Subsidy is being compulsorily activated.' Life Safety Subsidy activated compulsorily. The pain vanished as if it were never there, yet her life force continued its relentless ebb. She looked up, her eyes swirling with struggle and self-reproach, yet void of hate. Before the horde submerged her, Song Yunhuan caught the silent plea on her lips. 'Song Yunhuan, I'm sorry.' As if her only intention had been to scare him, but in a tragic twist of fate, she had failed to maintain her grip. Song Yunhuan stepped out of the warehouse. The zombies scattered in terror, each one avoiding Song Yunhuan's presence. Upon awakening, Song Yunhuan discovered his body decaying, yet inexplicably, his flesh was reconstituting itself. He did not become the grotesque form of a zombie. Instead, he retained his previous appearance, the only difference being his newfound boundless energy, immense strength, and a corpse-like body devoid of a heartbeat. His hatred for Bai Weiwei ran deep—he detested the transformation she had caused. This intense loathing drove him to subject her to the same hellish ordeal he had endured. Though Bai Weiwei was numb to pain, she remained acutely aware of the extent of her injuries. Her body was a mosaic of trauma. As her grip on consciousness began to wane, Bai Weiwei thought her end was certain. But then, as if by some miracle, the zombies dispersed. Her face was deathly pale, marked by the zombies' ferocity, a sight too harrowing to behold. When Song Yunhuan approached, Bai Weiwei's eyes met his. Her face, untouched by the chaos, still held its delicate beauty, and now, clouded with confusion, she exuded a pitiable softness. 'Does it hurt?' Song Yunhuan asked softly. Bai Weiwei could only gaze back, her pain so profound it left her without words. Her hand, stained with blood from her struggle, reached out. 'Song Yunhuan...' She struggled to draw closer to him. Song Yunhuan, feigning concern, leaned in closer, responding with a nonchalant hum, as if comforting a pitiable creature beneath his concern. Bai Weiwei mustered the strength to sit up, reaching her physical limits. She was unable to stand, but her hand managed to graze his face. Chapter 208: The Zombie King's Irresistible Girlfriend (9) Dust and blood from her fingers smeared his face. Yunhuan Song remained stoic, seemingly bracing for her scornful invectives. Yet, Bai Weiwei sighed a breath of relief, her voice emanating a delicate softness, "Yunhuan Song, is my life coming to an end?" With a calm resolve, Yunhuan Song affirmed, "Yes." Bai Weiwei felt a sense of release, "Before I depart, may I share a few words with you?" Yunhuan Song watched her silently, his detachment palpable. Suddenly, Bai Weiwei's other hand seized his garment, pulling his head down with the last ounce of her energy. Yunhuan Song's frame stiffened, the red in his eyes deepening. Their lips touched briefly, and Bai Weiwei confessed with a smile, "I have deceived you so many times, feigning innocence, naivety, and pitifulness. But my affection for you, that has never been a lie." As she smiled, tears streamed down her cheeks. "I apologize for not grasping your hand earlier, causing you to fall, it was not intentional..." Her voice dwindled to a whisper. Her fingers lost their strength, slowly releasing his clothing. "Yunhuan Song, I hold affection for you..." She fell back to the ground, her eyes beginning to dim, death's pallor spreading over her. Darkness enveloped her, and she finally lost consciousness. It took a moment for Yunhuan Song to come to his senses and touch his lips, still feeling the imprint of her kiss, tainted with the blood from her fingers. He tasted it, finding the flavor unexpectedly sweet—humans were indeed the most delectable feast to his zombie palate. Yunhuan Song, my affection for you... Affection, is that so? [Ding, the male lead's favorability has dropped to negative thirty-five.] --- Bai Weiwei was certain it was the end. Captured and bitten by zombies, she was on the brink of transformation into a zombie. The Life Safety Subsidy, a measure designed to temporarily shield one's lifeforce from the brink, could sustain her for only a day, after which she would face excruciating agony. In a daze, she spoke to the System: "System, how can I pursue Yunhuan Song if I become a zombie? Bald, with crooked teeth and a face of decay, my entrails dangling... he certainly won't grow fonder of me." The System assured her with a gentle voice: "Fear not, we'll cleanse the necrotic tissue as per traditional medicinal practices, tuck the entrails back in, stitch it all up, and a wig will have you looking lovely again." Touched, Bai Weiwei asked in her delirium, "System, am I truly lovely?" The System replied: "Of course, even as a zombie, you'd be the fairest of them all." With renewed vigor, Bai Weiwei struggled until her eyes fluttered open, only to be met with confusion—she was in the room of an old house, well-worn but clean, with an air of long habitation. The pale green curtains fluttered in the wind. She arose, her wounds healed to white scars, her heartbeat and body wholly human. Against all odds, she had not turned. With relief, Bai Weiwei stepped out of bed and walked barefoot into the living room. There sat Yunhuan Song, absorbed in reading. His gaze lifted gently to her, "Awake?" Puzzled, Bai Weiwei inquired, "I'm not dead?" Yunhuan Song shook his head, "You have a unique constitution, immune to the zombie virus." Her eyes widened with surprise, then sparkled with joy, "Is that so? I am indeed fortunate." Seeing her exuberant smile, Yunhuan Song too smiled, "When you said you liked me, was that true?" Caught off guard, Bai Weiwei blushed, hesitating before finally looking up with courage. Her eyes shone brightly, filled with mirth, "Yes, I like you." Yunhuan Song's finger tensed against the book. Calming the turmoil within him, he stepped closer and tenderly stroked her cheek. With a gentle smile, he asked, "If your affection for me is so profound, would you be willing to die for me?" Bai Weiwei: "..."
